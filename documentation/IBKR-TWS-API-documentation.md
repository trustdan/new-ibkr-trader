## IntroductionCopy Location

The TWS API is a TCP Socket Protocol API based on connectivity to the  Trader Workstation or IB Gateway. The API acts as an interface to  retrieve and send data autonomously to Interactive Brokers. Interactive  Brokers provides code systems in Python, Java, C++, C#, and VisualBasic.

The TWS API is a message protocol as its core, and any library that  implements the TWS API, whether created by IB or someone else, is a tool to send and receive these messages over a TCP socket connection with  the IB host platform (TWS or IB Gateway). As such the system can be  tweaked and modified into any language of interest given the intention  to translate the underlying decoder.

In short, a library written  in any other languages must be sending and receiving the same data in  the same format as any other conformant TWS API library, so users can  look at the documentation for our libraries to see what a given request  or response consists of (what it must include, in what form, etc.) and  implement them in their own structure.

Our TWS API components are aimed at experienced professional developers  willing to enhance the current TWS functionality. Before you use TWS  API, please make sure you fully understand the concepts of OOP (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/) and other Computer Science Concepts. Regrettably, Interactive Brokers  cannot offer any programming consulting. Before contacting our API  support, please always refer to our available documentation, sample  applications and Recorded Webinars

This guide references the Java, VB, C#, C++ and Python Testbed sample projects to demonstrate the TWS  API functionality. Code snippets are extracted from these projects and  we suggest all those users new to the TWS API to get familiar with them  in order to quickly understand the fundamentals of our programming  interface. The Testbed sample projects can be found within the samples  folder of the TWS APIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s installation directory.

## Notes & LimitationsCopy Location

While Interactive Brokers does maintain a Python, Java, C#, and C++ offering  for the TWS API, C# and our Excel offerings are exclusively available  for Windows PC. As a result, these features are not available on Linux  or Mac OS.

### RequirementsCopy Location

- A funded and opened IBKR Pro account
- The current Stable or Latest release of the TWS or IB Gateway
- The current Stable or Latest release of the TWS API
- A working knowledge of the programming language our **Testbed** sample projects are developed in.

The minimum supported language version is documented on the right for each of our supported languages.

Please be sure to toggle the indicated language to the language of your choosing.

-

Minimum supported Python release is version 3.0.0.

### LimitationsCopy Location

Our programming interface is designed to automate some of the operations a  user normally performs manually within the TWS Software such as placing  orders, monitoring your account balance and positions, viewing an  instrumentÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s live dataÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ etc. There is no logic within the API other than to ensure the integrity of the exchanged messages. Most validations and checks occur in the backend of TWS and our servers. Because of this it  is highly convenient to familiarize with the TWS itself, in order to  gain a better understanding on how our platform works. Before spending  precious development time troubleshooting on the API side, it is  recommended to first experiment with the TWS directly.

**Remember:** If a certain feature or operation is not available in the TWS, it will not be available on the API side either!

### Paper TradingCopy Location

If your regular trading account has been approved and funded, you can use your Account Management page to open a [Paper Trading Account](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/papertradingaccount.htm) which lets you use the full range of trading facilities in a simulated  environment using real market conditions. Using a Paper Trading Account  will allow you not only to get familiar with the TWS API but also to  test your trading strategies without risking your capital. Note the  paper trading environment has inherent [limitations](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/aboutpapertradingaccounts.htm).

## Download TWS or IB GatewayCopy Location

In order to use the TWS API, all customers must install either Trader  Workstation or IB Gateway to connect the API to. Both downloads maintain the same level of usage and support; however, they both have equal  benefits. For example, IB Gateway will be less resource intensive as  there is no UI; however, the Trader Workstation has access all of the  same information as the API, if users would like an interface to confirm data.



 [Download Trader Workstation](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php#tws-software) [Download IB Gateway](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-stable.php)

### TWS Online or Offline Version?Copy Location

It is recommended for API users to use offline TWS because TWS online  version has automatic update. Please use same TWS version to make sure  the TWS version and TWS API version are synced. These will help  preventing version conflict issue.

### Best Practice: Configure TWS / IB GatewayCopy Location

The information listed below are not required or necessary in order to  operate the TWS API. However, these steps include many references which  can help improve the day to day usage of the TWS API that is not  explicitly offered as a callable method within the API itself.

### "Never Lock Trader Workstation" SettingCopy Location

Note: For IBHK API users, it is commended to use IB Gateway instead of TWS.  It is because all IBHK users cannot choose ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never Lock Trader  WorkstationÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â in TWS ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Global Configuration ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Lock and Exit.

### Connected IB Server Location in TWSCopy Location

Each IB account has a pre-decided IB server. You can visit this link to know our IB serversÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ locations: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/download/IB-Host-and-Ports.pdf

Yet, all IB paper accounts are connected to US server by default and its location cannot be changed.

As IB servers in different regions have different scheduled server maintenance time ( [https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php ](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php)), you may need to change the IB server location in order to avoid service downtime.

For checking your connected IB server location, you can go to TWS and click ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“DataÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â to see your Primary server. In the below image, the pre-decided  IB server location is: cdc1.ibllc.com

![TWS Connections Window. ](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5.png)



If you want to change your live IB account server location in TWS, please  submit a web ticket to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Technical AssistanceÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ConnectivityÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â in order  to request changing the IB server location.

In the web ticket, you need to provide:

1. Which account do you want to have IB server location change?
2. Which IB server location would you like to connect to?
   - TWS AMERICA ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ EAST (New York)

3. Which IB scheduled maintenance  time do you choose? (Recommended to choose the default schedule  maintenance time of its own IB server location)
   - North America
   - Europe
   - Asia

After you submit the ticket, you will receive a web ticket reply which **require you to confirm and understand the migration request**.



Note:

1. For Internet users, as the connection between IB server and Exchange goes  through a dedicated line, it is commonly recommended to choose a IB  server location which is closer to your TWS location. For IB connection  types, please visit: https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/software/connectionInterface.php
2. The pre-decided IB server location connected from TWS is different from the IB Server location connected from IB Client Portal and IBKR Mobile.
   - IB server location connected from TWS is pre-decided. You can submit a web ticket to request the IB server relocation for the TWS connection.
   - IB server location connected from Client Portal, IBKR Mobile is based on  your nearest IB server location. You cannot request the IB server  relocation for Client Portal and IBKR Mobile connections. However, OAuth CP API users can specify which server they want to connect to by  themselves.

### Intelligent Order ResubmissionCopy Location

The TWS Setting listed in the Global Configuration under API -> Setting for **Maintain and resubmit orders when connection is restored**, is enabled by default in TWS 10.28 and above. When this setting is  checked, all orders received while connectivity is lost will be saved  and automatically resubmitted when connectivity is restored. Please  note, if the Trader Workstation is closed during this time, the orders  are deleted regardless of the setting.

### Disconnect on Invalid FormatCopy Location

The TWS Setting listed in the Global Configuration under API -> Setting for **Maintain connection upon receiving incorrectly formatted fields**, is enabled by default in TWS 10.28 and above. For clients operating on  Client Version 100 and above, users will not disconnect from fields with invalid value submissions when the setting is enabled.

## Download the TWS APICopy Location

It is recommended for API users to use same TWS API version to make sure  the TWS version and TWS API version are synced in order to prevent  version conflict issue.



Running the Windows version of the API installer creates a directory ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“C:\\TWS API\ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â for the API source  code in addition to automatically copying two files into the Windows  directory for the DDE and C++ APIs. ***It is important that the API installs to the C: drive\***, as otherwise API applications may not be able to find the associated  files. The Windows installer also copies compiled dynamic linked  libraries (DLL) of the ActiveX control TWSLib.dll, C# API CSharpAPI.dll, and C++ API TwsSocketClient.dll. Starting in API version **973.07**, running the API installer is designed to install an ActiveX control  TWSLib.dll, and TwsRtdServer control TwsRTDServer.dll which are  compatible with both 32 and 64 bit applications.



It is important to know that the TWS API is **only** available through the interactivebrokers.github.io MSI or ZIP file. Any other resource, including pip, NuGet, or any other online repository is not hosted, endorsed, supported, or connected to Interactive Brokers.  As such, updates to the installation should always be downloaded from  the github directly.

## TWSAPI Basics TutorialCopy Location

Many of our most common features, as well as instructions for installing and running the Trader Workstation API, are available in our TWS API  Tutorial Series. The series uses Python to implement the TWS API  functionality; however, the function calls are identical across  languages, and will follow a similar patter regardless of language.

This tutorial covers:

- Downloading and running the Trader Workstation and IB Gateway
- How to install the TWS API and update the Python Interpreter
- Requesting Live and Historical Market Data
- Placing and Monitoring Orders
- Reviewing Individual Account Information
- Handling Market Scanners

## Third Party API PlatformsCopy Location

Third party software vendors make use of the TWSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ programming interface (API) to integrate their platforms with Interactive BrokerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s. Thanks to the  TWS API, well known platforms such as Ninja Trader or Multicharts can  interact with the TWS to fetch market data, place orders and/or manage  account and portfolio information.

**It is important to keep in mind that most third party API platforms are not compatible with all IBKR account structures**. Always check first with the software vendor before opening a specific  account type or converting an IBKR account type. For instance, many  third party API platforms such as NinjaTrader and TradeNavigator are **not** compatible with IBKR linked account structures, so it is highly  recommended to first check with the third party vendor before linking  your IBKR accounts.

An ongoing list of common [Third Party Connections](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/third-party-connections/) are available within our documentation. This resource will also link  out to connection guides detailing how a user can connect with a given  platform.

A non-exhaustive list of third party platforms implementing our interface can be found in our [InvestorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Marketplace](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/MarketPlace.MarketPlaceServlet). As stated in the marketplace, the vendorsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ list is in no way a  recommendation from Interactive Brokers. If you are interested in a  given platform that is not listed, please contact the platformÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s vendor  directly for further information.

### Non-Standard TWS API Languages and PackagesCopy Location

Noted in further depth through our [Architecture](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#architecture) section, the TWS API is built using standardized socket protocol. As a  result, users may develop or access alternative third party modules and  classes in place of Interactive Brokers default modules through the [TWS API Download](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#find-the-api). While the API is adaptable for client implementations, please understand that **Interactive Brokers API Support cannot provide support for non-standard implementations.** While we can review your [API logs](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#api-logs) to affirm what content is being submitted, any further assistance will need to take place with the moduleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s original developer.

*This is neither an endorsement or admonishment of third party  implementations. Interactive Brokers will always advise clients use our  direct TWS API implementation whenever possible.*

### ib_insync and ib_asyncCopy Location

While Interactive BrokersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ API Support is aware of the ib_insync package, we [cannot provide coding assistance](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#troubleshooting) for the package.

With that in mind, users should be aware that the original ib_insync package is built using a legacy release of the TWS API and is no longer  updated. Users who wish to implement the ib_insync structure using  supported releases of the Trader Workstation should migrate to the [ib_async package](https://pypi.org/project/ib_async/), which is a modernized implementation of the package by one of its original developers.

*This is neither an endorsement or admonishment of either the ib_insync or  ib_async library. Interactive Brokers will always advise clients use our direct TWS API implementation whenever possible.*

## Unique ConfigurationsCopy Location

While all of the available Trader Workstation API default samples provide  equivalent functionality, some languages have unique configurations that must be implemented in order to use our samples or program code with  the underlying API.

### Implementing the Intel Decimal Library for MacOS and LinuxCopy Location

Due to the malleability of the many Linux distributions including MacOS,  Interactive Brokers is unable to provide a pre-built binary for the  library. As such, users programming in C++ on a Linux machine must  manually build the IntelÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Decimal Floating-Point Math Library manually.

As described in the README file from the linked page, you can find the  libraryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s build steps within the ~/IntelRDFPMathLib20U2/LIBRARY/README  file.

 [Download the IntelÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Decimal Floating-Point Math Library](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/intel-decimal-floating-point-math-library.html)

### Updating The Python InterpreterCopy Location

Python has a unique system for importing libraries into itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s IDEs. This  extends even further when it comes to virtual environments. In order to  utilize Python code with the TWS API, you must run our setup file in  order to import the code.

### 1. Open Command Prompt or TerminalCopy Location

In order to update the Python IDE, these steps MUST be performed through  Command Prompt or Terminal. This can not be done through an explorer  interface.

As such, users should begin by launching their respective command line interface.

These samples will display Windows commands, though the procedure is identical on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

![Standard command prompt window.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/setupCmd-700x298.png)



### 2. Navigate to Python SourceCopy Location

Customers should then change their directory to

{TWS API}\source\pythonclient

 .



It is then recommend to display the contents of the directory with ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“lsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â for Unix, or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“dirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â for Windows users.

![Contents of python source directory.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/setupCmdCd-700x511.png)



### 3. Run The setup.py FileCopy Location

Customers will now need to run the setup.py steps with the installation parameter. This can be done with the command:

python setup.py install



![setup.py install command.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/setupCmdInstall.png)



### 4. Confirm UpdatesCopy Location

After running the prior command, users should see a large block of text  describing various values being updated and added to their system. It is important to confirm that the version installed on your system mirrors  the build version displayed. This example represents 10.25; however, you may have a different version.

![Updated packages from setup.py](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/setupCmdUpdate-700x346.png)



### 5. Confirm your installationCopy Location

Finally, users should look to confirm their installation. The simplest way to do this is to confirm their version with pip. Typing this command should  show the latest installed version on your system:

python -m pip show ibapi



![Result of pip command](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/setupCmdShowIbapi-700x150.png)



### Python 10.35.1 Protobuf Upgrade InstructionsCopy Location

With the introduction of TWSAPI 10.35.1, Interactive Brokers has begun shifting our API offering to include the [Google Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) (Protobuf) to help with data serialization. The inclusion of Protobuf will allow  Interactive Brokers and our clients to expand our software into new  programming languages through popular standards. While the new features  are exciting, we have observed that Python requires some additional  steps regarding setup that clients should look to follow.

Interactive Brokers is actively working to improve the file installation to  automate this process. Though for now, the steps mentioned below wold  otherwise need to be modified manually.

As mentionedin the *Installing the updated version* section, please ***run the setup.py after making all of the changes below***, or the protobuf errors will persist.

Files To Be Modified In Python Source:

- setup.py
- ibapi/client.py
- ibapi/decoder.py
- ibapi/protobuf/Contract_pb2.py
- ibapi/protobuf/ExecutionDetails_pb2.py
- ibapi/protobuf/ExecutionRequest_pb2.py

### Setup.pyCopy Location

We would need to first modify the setup.py file used to install the API at `{TWS API}/source/pythonclient/setup.py`.

1. Modify line 17 to reference `packages=["ibapi","ibapi/protobuf"],` to include our ibapi/protobuf directory.
2. Insert a new line after 17 for `install_requires=["protobuf"],` to automatically install the protobuf libray.
3. Save the file.

)



### ibapi/client.pyCopy Location

Next we would need to modify our client.py file saved at `{TWS API}/source/pythonclient/ibapi/client.py`.

1. On line 145, we will need to include `ibapi.` prior to our protobuf reference. The final line should appear as `from ibapi.protobuf.ComboLeg_pb2 import ComboLeg as ComboLegProto`
2. We will do the same for line 146, `from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionFilter_pb2 import ExecutionFilter as ExecutionFilterProto`.
3. And again on line 147, `from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionRequest_pb2 import ExecutionRequest as ExecutionRequestProto`
4. Save the file.

-

from ibapi.protobuf.ComboLeg_pb2 import ComboLeg as ComboLegProto

from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionFilter_pb2 import ExecutionFilter as ExecutionFilterProto

from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionRequest_pb2 import ExecutionRequest as ExecutionRequestProto



### ibapi/decoder.pyCopy Location

Identical to client.py, weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll need to reference the ibapi.protobuf file rather than the google.protobuf file.

1. Include `ibapi.` on line 33 prior to the protobuf reference. Our final line should appear as `from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionDetails_pb2 import ExecutionDetails as ExecutionDetailsProto`.
2. WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll do the same on line 34 for `from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionDetailsEnd_pb2 import ExecutionDetailsEnd as ExecutionDetailsEndProto`.
3. Save the file.

-

from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionDetails_pb2 import ExecutionDetails as ExecutionDetailsProto

from ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionDetailsEnd_pb2 import ExecutionDetailsEnd as ExecutionDetailsEndProto



### ibapi/protobuf/Contract_pb2.pyCopy Location

Again, we wil reference ibapi.protobuf rather than a direct protobuf package.

1. On line 25, weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll prepend the value to `ibapi.protobuf.` rather than as the direct package reference. The final line 25 should appear as `import ibapi.protobuf.ComboLeg_pb2 as ComboLeg__pb2`.
2. We will do the same on line 26, `import ibapi.protobuf.DeltaNeutralContract_pb2 as DeltaNeutralContract__pb2`.
3. Save the file.

-

import ibapi.protobuf.ComboLeg_pb2 as ComboLeg__pb2

import ibapi.protobuf.DeltaNeutralContract_pb2 as DeltaNeutralContract__pb2



### ibapi/protobuf/ExecutionDetails_pb2.pyCopy Location

We will again prepend `ibapi.protobuf.`.

1. WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll first modify line 25, to show `import ibapi.protobuf.Contract_pb2 as Contract__pb2`.
2. We will do the same for line 26, `import ibapi.protobuf.Execution_pb2 as Execution__pb2`.
3. Save the file.

-

import ibapi.protobuf.Contract_pb2 as Contract__pb2

import ibapi.protobuf.Execution_pb2 as Execution__pb2



### ibapi/protobuf/ExecutionRequest_pb2.pyCopy Location

And for the final time, we can prepend ibapi.protobuf.
 Update line 25, import ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionFilter_pb2 as ExecutionFilter__pb2

-

import ibapi.protobuf.ExecutionFilter_pb2 as ExecutionFilter__pb2



### Installing the updated version.Copy Location

Once all 6 files have been updated, we will need to run the setup.py script  to update the python interpreter. The process to update the interpretter is the same as what is mentioned in the [documentation](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#setup-python).

1. Navigate to `{TWS API}/source/pythonclient` through your terminal.
2. Run `python setup.py install` then press the return key. After a few moments, ibapi will update with our new files and should no longer cause an error.

### Protobuf UserWarning messagesCopy Location

After resolving the reference errors, using the TWSAPI may print a  UserWarning upon connection. These warnings are predominantly cosmetic  and can be ignored. These issues are caused by the Pypi release of  protobuf running version 6.30.1 and above, while the TWS API is built  with 5.29.3. The warning is simply notifying users that their version is 1 major version different. However, given protobuf is currently  backgwards compatible, this should not present any issues with the  implementation. Developers uncomfortable with the warning messages have a few options:

1. [Recompile Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/pythontutorial/) against their [Github 5.29.3 version](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/v5.29.3) to maintain parity with the TWS API implementations.
2. Users can also modify the code source, linked by the protobuf warning, and  simply remove lines 94 and on from the runtime_version.py file.

### Implementing Visual Basic .NETCopy Location

Our VB.NET code is provided for demonstration purposes only; there is no  pure, standalone VB.NET-based TWS API library. Both our ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“VB_API_SampleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  and the VB.NET ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“TestbedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â projects included with our TWS API releases  call the C# TWS API source. The provided VB.NET code only interfaces  with the C# source. Please keep in mind that these samples are in  VB.NET, not Visual Basic for Applications.

## Troubleshooting & SupportCopy Location

If there are remaining questions about available API functionality after  reviewing the content of this documentation, the API Support group is  available to help.

-> It is important to keep in mind that IB **cannot provide programming assistance** or give suggestions on how to code custom applications. The API group can  review log files which contain a record of communications between API  applications and TWS, and give details about what the API can provide.

General suggestions on starting out with the IB system:

- **Become familiar with the analogous functionality in TWS before using the API**: the TWS API is nothing but a communication channel between your client  application and TWS. Each API function has a corresponding tool in TWS.  For instance, the market data tick types in the API correspond to  watchlist columns in TWS. Any order which can be created in the API can  first be created in TWS, and it is recommended to do so. Additionally,  if information is not available in TWS, it will not be available in the  API. Before using IB Gateway with the API, it is recommended to first  become familiar with TWS.
- **Make use of the sample API applications**: the sample applications distributed with the API download have examples of essentially every API function in each of the available programming  languages. If an issue does not occur in the corresponding sample  application, that implies there is a problem with the custom  implementation.
- **Upgrade TWS or IB Gateway periodically**:  TWS and IB Gateway often have new software releases that have  enhancements, and that can sometimes have bug fixes. Because of this, we strongly recommend our users to keep their software as up to date as  possible. If you are experiencing a specific problem that is occurring  in TWS or IB Gateway and not in the API program, it is likely resolved  in the more recent software build.

### Log FilesCopy Location

Log files are used by developers and support to unambiguously understand the behavior of a request.

These files are stored on the clients machine and are only sent to Interactive Brokers by client request.

These logs will recycle every 7 days. This would include the current day and the prior 6 days.

### API LogsCopy Location

TWS and IB Gateway can be configured to create a separate log file which  has a record of just communications with API applications. This log is  not enabled by default; but needs to be enabled by the Global  Configuration setting **ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Create API Message Log FileÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â**(picture below).

- API logs contain a record of exchanged messages between API applications  and TWS/IB Gateway. Since only API messages are recorded, the API logs  are more compact and easier to handle. However they do not contain  general diagnostic information about TWS/IBG as the TWS/IBG logs. The  TWS/IBG settings folder is by default **C:\Jts** (or IBJts on Mac/Linux). The API logs are named **api.[clientId].[day].log**, where [clientId] corresponds to the Id the client application used to  connect to the TWS and [day] to the week day (i.e. api.123.Thu.log).
- There is also a setting ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Include Market Data in API LogÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â that will include  streaming market data values in the API log file. Historical candlestick data is always recorded in the API log.

**Note:** Both  the API and TWS logs are encrypted locally. The API logs can be  decrypted for review from the associated TWS or IB Gateway session, just like the TWS logs, as shown in the section describing the Local  location of logs.

**Note:** The TWS/IB Gateway log file setting has to be set to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œDetailÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ level before an issue occurs so that  information recorded correctly when it manifests. However due to the  high amount of information that will be generated under this level, the  resulting logs can grow considerably in size.


**Enabling creation of API logs**

TWS:

1. Navigate to File/Edit ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Global Configuration ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ API ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Settings
2. Check the box *Create API message log file*
3. Set *Logging Level* to *Detail*
4. Click Apply and Ok

### How To Enable Debug LoggingCopy Location

Enabling DEBUG-level logging for the host platform (TWS or IBG, this does not affect API logs):

1. Navigate to the root TWS/IBG installation directory
2. Find jts.ini and open in text editor
3. Put debug=1 under the [Communication] section
4. Reboot TWS/IBG

Setting debug=1 has added benefits in TWS.

1. Debug=1 also allows you to enter conIds into a watchlist to resolve them into  symbols. Type/paste the conId in an empty watchlist row, add |C  (vertical bar, capital C) at the end, and press Enter. Example: 265598|C will resolve immediately to AAPL (exchange will be SMART where  available, primary otherwise).

### Location of Interactive Brokers LogsCopy Location

Logs are stored in the TWS settings directory, C:\Jts\ and then your user  subdirectory by default on a Windows computer (the default can be  configured differently on the login screen).

The path to the log file directory can be found from a TWS or IB Gateway session by using the combination **Ctrl-Alt-U**. This will reveal path such as C:\Jts\detcfsvirl\ (on Windows).

Due to privacy regulations, logs are **encrypted** before they are saved to disk. To review them on your machine, you may need to [Export Your Logs](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#export-logs) from the associated TWS or IB Gateway session.

### How To Delete LogsCopy Location

In some instances, your logs may be too large to export or upload for  Client Services to review. In scenarios such as this, the Support team  may request that you delete your existing API logs, and then replicate  the error before attempting to upload them again.

To delete your logs:

1. [Locate your Logs](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#log-location).
2. Exit TWS or IB Gateway session by clicking ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“FileÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ExitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

### Reading Exported LogsCopy Location

Each supported API language of the API contains a message file that  translates a given number identifier into their corresponding request.  The message identifier numbers used in the underlying wire protocol is  the core of the TWS API.

The information on the right documents  where each message reader file is located. The {TWS API} listed is the  path to the primary TWS API or JTS folder created from the API  installation.

By default, this will be saved directly on the C: drive.

-

Both the Incoming and Outgoing message IDs are listed in one file.

{TWS API}\source\pythonclient\ibapi\messages.py

In our API logs, the direction of the message is indicated by the arrow at the beginning:

**->** for incoming messages (TWS to client)

**<-** for outgoing messages (client to TWS)

Thus **<- 3** (outgoing request of type 3) is a placeOrder request, and the subsequent incoming requests are:

**-> 5** = openOrder response

**-> 11** = executionData response

**-> 59** = commissionReport response

Also note that the first openOrder response carries with it an orderStatus  response in the same message. If that status were to change later, it  would be delivered as a standalone message:

**-> 3** = orderStatus response

### Unset ValuesCopy Location

Developers may often find a super-massive value returned from requests like market data, P&L information, and elsewhere. These are known as Unset  values. Unset values are used throughout programming systems to indicate that a value is not available. Unset values are used in place of NULL  characters to prevent any unexpected error be thrown in your code. Unset values are also used in place of values like 0 to avoid confusing  viewers to believe they have an account balance of 0, or that an equity  is worth $0.

An unset value is the maximum value of a given data  type. So the Unset Double value will appear like 1.7976931348623157E308, which contains approximately 308 digits to intentionally appear  extraneous.

## ArchitectureCopy Location

The TWS API is a BSD implementation that communicates request and response  values across TCP socket using a end-line-delimited message protocol.  While the underlying structure of the message will vary by request,  requests typically follow a patter of indicating a message identifier,  request identifier, and then directly relevant content for the request  such as contract details or market data parameters.

The provided  TWS API package use two distinct classes to accommodate the request /  response functionality of the socket protocol, EClient and EWrapper  respectively.

The EWrapper class is used to receive all messages from the host and  distribute them amongst the affiliated response functions. The EReader  class will retrieve the messages from the socket connection and decode  them for distribution by the EWrapper class.

-

class TestWrapper(wrapper.EWrapper):



EClient or EClientSocket is used to send requests to the Trader Workstation.  This client class contains all the available methods to communicate with the host. Up to 32 clients can be connected to a single instance of the host Trader Workstation or IB Gateway simultaneously.

The primary distinction in EClient and EClientSocket is the involvement of the  EReader Class to trigger when requests should be processed. EClient is  unique to the Python implementation and utilizes the Python Queue module in place of the EReaderSignal directly. Both the EReaderSignal and  Python Queue module handle the queueing process for submitting messages  across the socket connection. In either scenario, the EWrapper class  must be implemented first to acknowledge the EClient requests.

-

class TestClient(EClient):

ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¹     def __init__(self, wrapper):

ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¹         EClient.__init__(self, wrapper)

...

class TestApp(TestWrapper, TestClient):

  def __init__(self):

  TestWrapper.__init__(self)

ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¹         TestClient.__init__(self, wrapper=self)

**Note**: The EReaderSignal class is not used for Python API. The Python Queue module is used for inter-thread communication and data exchange.

### The Trader WorkstationCopy Location

Our market maker-designed IBKR Trader Workstation (TWS) lets traders,  investors, and institutions trade stocks, options, futures, forex,  bonds, and funds on over 100 markets worldwide from a single account.  The TWS API is a programming interface to TWS, and as such, for an  application to connect to the API there must first be a running instance of TWS or IB Gateway.

### The IB GatewayCopy Location

As an alternative to TWS for API users, IBKR also offers IB Gateway  (IBGW). From the perspective of an API application, IB Gateway and TWS  are identical; both represent a server to which an API client  application can open a socket connection after the user has  authenticated. With either application (TWS or IBGW), the user must  manually enter their username and password into a login window. For  security reasons, a headless session of TWS or IBGW without a GUI is not supported. From the userÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s perspective, IB Gateway may be advantageous  because it is a lighter application which consumes about 40% fewer  resources.

Both TWS and IBGW were designed to be restarted daily.  This is necessary to perform functions such as re-downloading contract  definitions in cases where contracts have been changed or new contracts  have been added. Beginning in version 974+ both applications offer an  autorestart feature that allows the application to restart daily without user intervention. With this option enabled, TWS or IBGW can  potentially run from Sunday to Sunday without re-authenticating. After  the nightly server reset on Saturday night it will be necessary to again enter security credentials.

The advantages of TWS over IBGW is  that it provides the end user with many tools (Risk Navigator,  OptionTrader, BookTrader, etc) and a graphical user interface which can  be used to monitor an account or place orders. For beginning API users,  it is recommended to first become acquainted with TWS before using IBGW.

**For simplicity, this guide will mostly refer to the TWS although the reader should understand that for the TWS APIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s purposes, TWS and IB Gateway  are synonymous.**

## Pacing LimitationsCopy Location

Pacing Limitations with regards to the TWS API are based on the number of  requests submitted by a client connection. A ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“requestÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â is a  user-submitted query to retrieve some form of data.

An example of a request is a query to retrieve [live watchlist data](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#watchlist-data). While you may make a single request for market data, you will receive  market data until the subscription is cancelled or your session is  disconnected. Only the original request to begin the flow of data will  contribute to the pacing limitation.

The maximum number of API requests that can be submitted are equivalent to your [Maximum Market Data Lines](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/market-data-subscriptions/#costs-and-fees) divided by 2, per second.

By default, all users maintain 100 market data lines. Therefore, users have a pacing limitation of (100/2)= **50 requests per second**.

Clients that have increased their market data lines to 200, by way of commission or [Quote Booster Subscription](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/market-data-subscriptions/#quote-max), would receive (200/2)= 100 requests per second, and this would increment as your market data lines increase or decrease.

In some use cases, if you plan to send more than 50 requests per second,  some orders may be queued and delayed. For this scenario, please  consider switching to FIX API.

For FIX API users in IB Gateway, the limitation is 250 messages per second.

For FIX API users without using IB Gateway or TWS, there is no limitation on messages per second, but less is better.

## ConnectivityCopy Location

A socket connection between the API client application and TWS is  established with the IBApi.EClientSocket.eConnect function. TWS acts as a server to receive requests from the API application (the client) and  responds by taking appropriate actions. The first step is for the API  client to initiate a connection to TWS on a socket port where TWS is  already listening. It is possible to have multiple TWS instances running on the same computer if each is configured with a different API socket  port number. Also, each TWS session can receive up to 32 different  client applications simultaneously. The client ID field specified in the API connection is used to distinguish different API clients.

### Establishing an API connectionCopy Location

Once our two main objects have been created, EWrapper and ESocketClient, the client application can connect via the IBApi.EClientSocket object:

-

app.connect("127.0.0.1", args.port, clientId=0)



eConnect starts by requesting from the operating system that a TCP socket be  opened to the specified IP address and socket port. If the socket cannot be opened, the operating system (not TWS) returns an error which is  received by the API client as error code 502  to IBApi.EWrapper.error (Note: since this error is not generated by TWS  it is not captured in TWS log files). Most commonly error 502 will  indicate that TWS is not running with the API enabled, or it is  listening for connections on a different socket port. If connecting  across a network, the error can also occur if there is a firewall or  antivirus program blocking connections, or if the routerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s IP address is not listed in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trusted IPsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â in TWS.

After the socket has been opened, there must be an initial handshake in which information is  exchanged about the supported version of the TWS and API to ensure each  platform can interpret received messages correctly.

- For this  reason it is important that the main EReader object is not created until after a connection has been established. The initial connection results in a negotiated common version between TWS and the API client which  will be needed by the EReader thread in interpreting subsequent  messages.

After the highest version number which can be used for communication is established, TWS will return certain pieces of  data that correspond specifically to the logged-in TWS userÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s session.  This includes (1) the account number(s) accessible in this TWS session,  (2) the next valid order identifier (ID), and (3) the time of  connection. In the most common mode of operation the  EClient.AsyncEConnect field is set to false and the initial handshake is taken to completion immediately after the socket connection is  established. TWS will then immediately provides the API client with this information.

- Important: The **IBApi.EWrapper.nextValidID** callback is commonly used to indicate that the connection is completed and other messages can be sent from the API client to TWS. There is the  possibility that function calls made prior to this time could be dropped by TWS.

There is an alternative, deprecated mode of  connection used in special cases in which the variable AsyncEconnect is  set to true, and the call to startAPI is only called from the  connectAck() function. All IB samples use the mode AsyncEconnect =  False.

### The EReader ThreadCopy Location

API programs always have at least two threads of execution. One thread is  used for sending messages to TWS, and another thread is used for reading returned messages. The second thread uses the API EReader class to read from the socket and add messages to a queue. Everytime a new message is added to the message queue, a notification flag is triggered to let  other threads know that there is a message waiting to be processed. In  the two-thread design of an API program, the message queue is also  processed by the first thread. In a three-thread design, an additional  thread is created to perform this task. The thread responsible for the  message queue will decode messages and invoke the appropriate functions  in EWrapper. The two-threaded design is used in the IB Python sample  Program.py and the C++ sample TestCppClient, while the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œTestbedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ samples in the other languages use a three-threaded design. Commonly in a  Python asynchronous network application, the asyncio module will be used to create a more sequential looking code design.

The class which has functionality for reading and parsing raw messages from TWS is the IBApi.EReader class.

### C++, C#, and Java ImplementationsCopy Location

For C#, Java, C++, and Visual Basic, we instead maintain a triple thread  structure which requires the creation of a reader thread, a queue  thread, and then a wrapper thread. The documentation listed here further elaborates on the structure for those languages.

-

Now it is time to revisit the role of IBApi.EReaderSignal initially  introduced in The EClientSocket Class. As mentioned in the previous  paragraph, after the EReader thread places a message in the queue, a  notification is issued to make known that a message is ready for  processing. In the (C++, C#/.NET, Java) APIs, this is done via the  IBApi.EReaderSignal object we initiated within the IBApi.EWrapperÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s  implementer.

### Python ImplementationCopy Location

In Python IB API, the EReader logic is handled in the EClient.connect so  the EReader thread is automatically started upon connection. There is **no need** for user to start the reader.

Once the client is connected, a reader thread will be automatically created  to handle incoming messages and put the messages into a message queue  for further process. User **is required** to trigger Client::run()  below, where the message queue is processed in an infinite loop and the  EWrapper call-back functions are automatically triggered.

Now it  is time to revisit the role of IBApi.EReaderSignal initially introduced  in The EClientSocket Class. As mentioned in the previous paragraph,  after the EReader thread places a message in the queue, a notification  is issued to make known that a message is ready for processing. In the  Python API, this is handled automatically by the Queue class.

### Remote TWS API Connections with Trader WorkstationCopy Location

If you want to connect TWS/ IB Gateway from a remote server, uncheck the  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Allow connection from localhost onlyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â setting. Under the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trusted IPsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  section, click ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“CreateÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and enter the IP Address detected in ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Accept  incoming connection attempt from <IP Address>ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â into ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trusted IPsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

In the following example, there is a remote computing cluster /27 which has 32 IP Addresses and the remote computing cluster will  randomly assign one of the computing nodes to connect to TWS in every  connection. To make this happen, every Private IPv4 Address of the  subnet are put into the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trusted IPsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â (You can also exclude the first IP Network Address and the last IP Broadcast Address of the subnet).

![TWS Global Configuration API Settings showing Trusted IPs section.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2-1.png)



### Accepting an API connection from TWSCopy Location

For security reasons, by default the API is not configured to automatically accept connection requests from API applications. After a connection  attempt, a dialogue will appear in TWS asking the user to manually  confirm that a connection can be made:

Untrusted IPs attempting to make a connection will be denied without prompting.

![Confirmation dialogue to confirm connection attempt.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/api_incoming_connection.png)



To prevent the TWS from asking the end user to accept the connection, it  is possible to configure it to automatically accept the connection from a trusted IP address and/or the local machine. This can easily be done  via the TWS API settings:

![TWS API settings with localhost and trust IP section.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/api_localhost_connections-700x476.png)



### Logging into multiple applicationsCopy Location

It is not possible to login to multiple trading applications  simultaneously with the same username. However, it is possible to create additional usernames for an account that can be used in different  trading applications simultaneously, as long as there is not more than a single trading application logged in with a given username at a time.  There are some additional cases in which it is also useful to create  additional usernames:

- If TWS or IBGW is logged in with a username that is used to login to  Client Portal during that session, that application will not be able to  automatically reconnect to the server after the next disconnection (such as the server reset).
- A TWS or IBGW session logged into a paper trading account will not to receive market data if it is sharing data  from a live user which is used to login to Client Portal.

If a different username is utilized to login to Client Portal in either of these cases, then it will not affect the TWS/IBGW session.

[How to add additional usernames in Account Management](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/uar/addingauser.htm)

- It is important to note that market data subscriptions are setup independently for each live username.

### Broken API socket connectionCopy Location

If there is a problem with the socket connection between TWS and the API  client, for instance if TWS suddenly closes, this will trigger an  exception in the EReader thread which is reading from the socket. This  exception will also occur if an API client attempts to connect with a  client ID that is already in use.

The socket EOF is handled  slightly differently in different API languages. For instance in Java,  it is caught and sent to the client application to  IBApi::EWrapper::error with errorCode 507: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad MessageÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. In C# it is  caught and sent to IBApi::EWrapper::error with errorCode -1. The client  application needs to handle this error message and use it to indicate  that an exception has been thrown in the socket connection.

Clients can validate a broken connection with the EWrapper.connectionClosed and EClient.isConnected functions.

## Account & Portfolio DataCopy Location

The IBApi.EClient.reqAccountSummary method creates a subscription for the  account data displayed in the TWS Account Summary window. It is commonly used with multiple-account structures. Introducing broker (IBroker)  accounts with more than 50 subaccounts or configured for on-demand  account lookup cannot use reqAccountSummary with group=ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂAllÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. A profile  name can be accepted in place of group. See Unification of Groups and  Profiles.

The TWS offers a comprehensive overview of your account  and portfolio through its Account and Portfolio windows. This  information can be obtained via the TWS API through three different kind of requests/operations.

### Account SummaryCopy Location

The initial invocation of reqAccountSummary will result in a list of all  requested values being returned, and then every three minutes those  values which have changed will be returned. The update frequency of 3  minutes is the same as the TWS Account Window and cannot be changed.

### Requesting Account SummaryCopy Location

Requests a specific accountÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s summary. This method will subscribe to the account summary as presented in the TWSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Account Summary tab. Customers can  specify the data received by using a specific tags value. See the  Account Summary Tags section for available options.

Alternatively, many languages offer the import of AccountSummaryTags with a method to retrieve all tag values.

#### EClient.cancelAccountSummary (

**reqId:** int. The identifier of the previously performed account request

)

self.cancelAccountSummary(9001)



### Account UpdatesCopy Location

The IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates function creates a subscription to the  TWS through which account and portfolio information is delivered. This  information is the exact same as the one displayed within the TWSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢  Account Window. Just as with the TWSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Account Window, unless there is a  position change this information is updated at a fixed interval of three minutes.

Unrealized and Realized P&L is sent to the API function  IBApi.EWrapper.updateAccountValue function after a subscription request  is made with IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates. This information  corresponds to the data in the TWS Account Window, and has a different  source of information, a different update frequency, and different reset schedule than PnL data in the TWS Portfolio Window and associated API  functions (below). In particular, the unrealized P&L information  shown in the TWS Account Window which is sent to updatePortfolioValue  will update either (1) when a trade for that particular instrument  occurs or (2) every 3 minutes. The realized P&L data in the TWS  Account Window is reset to 0 once per day.

It is important to keep in mind that the P&L data shown in the Account Window and Portfolio Window will sometimes differ because there is a different source of  information and a different reset schedule.

See [Profit & Loss](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#pnl) for alternative PnL data

### Requesting Account UpdatesCopy Location

Subscribes to a specific accountÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s information and portfolio. Through this method, a single accountÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s subscription can be started/stopped. As a result  from the subscription, the accountÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s information, portfolio and last  update time will be received at EWrapper.updateAccountValue,  EWrapper.updatePortfolio, EWrapper.updateAccountTime respectively. All  account values and positions will be returned initially, and then there  will only be updates when there is a change in a position, or to an  account value every 3 minutes if it has changed. Only one account can be subscribed at a time. A second subscription request for another account when the previous one is still active will cause the first one to be  canceled in favor of the second one.

#### EClient.reqAccountUpdates (

**subscribe:** bool. Set to true to start the subscription and to false to stop it.

**acctCode:** String. The account id (i.e. U123456) for which the information is requested.

### Cancel Account UpdatesCopy Location

Once the subscription to account updates is no longer needed, it can be  cancelled by invoking the IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates method while  specifying the susbcription flag to be False.

**Important:** only one account at a time can be subscribed at a time. Attempting a  second subscription without previously cancelling an active one will not yield any error message although it will override the already  subscribed account with the new one. With Financial Advisory (FA)  account structures there is an alternative way of specifying the account code such that information is returned for ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œAllÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ sub accounts- this is  done by appending the letter ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œAÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ to the end of the account number, i.e.  reqAccountUpdates(true, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“F123456AÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â)

-

self.reqAccountUpdatesMulti(reqId, self.account, "", False)



### Family CodesCopy Location

It is possible to determine from the API whether an account exists under  an account family, and find the family code using the function  reqFamilyCodes.

For instance, if individual account U112233 is  under a financial advisor with account number F445566, if the function  reqFamilyCodes is invoked for the user of account U112233, the family  code ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“F445566AÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â will be returned, indicating that it belongs within that account family.

### Request Family CodesCopy Location

#### EClient.reqFamilyCodes()

Requests family codes for an account, for instance if it is a FA, IBroker, or associated account.

-

self.reqFamilyCodes()



### Receive Family CodesCopy Location

#### EWrapper.familyCodes(

**familyCodes:** FamilyCodes[]. Unique family codes array of accountIds.

)

Returns array of family codes.

-

def familyCodes(self, familyCodes: ListOfFamilyCode):

ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¹    print("Family Codes:", familyCode)



### Managed AccountsCopy Location

A single user name can handle more than one account. As mentioned in the [Connectivity](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#connectivity) section, the TWS will automatically send a list of managed accounts once the  connection is established. The list can also be fetched via  the IBApi.EClient.reqManagedAccts method.

### Request Managed AccountsCopy Location

#### EClient.reqManagedAccts()

Requests the accounts to which the logged user has access to.

-

self.reqManagedAccts()



### Receive Managed AccountsCopy Location

#### EWrapper.managedAccounts (

**accountsList:** String. A comma-separated string with the managed account ids.

)

Returns a string of all available accounts for the logged in user. Occurs automatically on initial API client connection.

-

def managedAccounts(self, accountsList: str):

ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¹    print("Account list:", accountsList)



### PositionsCopy Location

A limitation of the function IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates is that it can only be used with a single account at a time. To create a subscription for position updates from multiple accounts, the function IBApi.EClient.reqPositions is available.

**Note:** The reqPositions function is not available in Introducing Broker or  Financial Advisor master accounts that have very large numbers of  subaccounts (> 50) to optimize the performance of TWS/IB Gateway.  Instead the function reqPositionsMulti can be used to subscribe to  updates from individual subaccounts. Also not available with IBroker  accounts configured for on-demand account lookup.

After initially  invoking reqPositions, information about all positions in all associated accounts will be returned, followed by the IBApi::EWrapper::positionEnd callback. Thereafter, when a position has changed an update will be returned to the IBApi::EWrapper::position function. To cancel a reqPositions subscription, invoke IBApi::EClient::cancelPositions.

### Positions By ModelCopy Location

The function IBApi.EClient.reqPositionsMulti can be used with any account  structure to subscribe to positions updates for multiple accounts and/or models. The account and model parameters are optional if there are not  multiple accounts or models available. It is more efficient to use this  function for a specific subset of accounts than using  IBApi.EClient.reqPositions. A profile name can be accepted in place of  group in the account parameter.

### Profit & Loss (PnL)Copy Location

Requests can be made to receive real time updates about the daily P&L and  unrealized P&L for an account, or for individual positions.  Financial Advisors can also request P&L figures for ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œAllÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢  subaccounts, or for a portfolio model. This is further extended to  include realized P&L information at the account or individual  position level.

The P&L API functions demonstrated below  return the data which is displayed in the TWS Portfolio Window in  current versions of TWS. As such, the P&L values are calculated  based on the reset schedule specified in TWS Global Configuration (by  default an instrument-specific reset schedule) and this setting affects  values sent to the associated API functions as well. Also in TWS,  P&L data from virtual forex positions will be included in the  account P&L if and only if the Virtual Fx section of the Account  Window is expanded.

See [Account Updates](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#account-updates) for alternative PnL data.

### Request P&L for individual positionsCopy Location

Currently updates are returned to IBApi.EWrapper.pnlSingle approximately once per second*.

- If a P&L subscription request is made for an invalid conId or contract not in the account, there will not be a response.
- As elsewhere in the API, a max double value will indicate an ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œunsetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ value. This corresponds to an empty cell in TWS.
- Introducing broker accounts without a large number of subaccounts (<50) can  receive aggregate data by specifying the account as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“AllÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

## Contracts (Financial Instruments)Copy Location

An IBApi.Contract object represents trading instruments such as a stocks,  futures or options. Every time a new request that requires a contract  (i.e. market data, order placing, etc.) is sent to TWS, the platform  will try to match the provided contract object with a single candidate.

### The Contract ObjectCopy Location

The Contract object is an object used throughout the TWS API to define the  target of your requests. Contract objects will be used for market data,  portfolios, orders, executions, and even some news request. This is the  staple structure used for all of the TWS API.

In all contracts,  the minimum viable structure requires at least a conId and exchange; or a symbol, secType, exchange, primaryExchange, and currency. Derivatives  will require additional fields, such as lastTradeDateOrExpiration,  tradingClass, multiplier, strikes, and so on.

The values to the  right represent the most common Contract values to pass for complete  contracts. For a more comprehensive list of contract structures, please  see [the Contracts page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/contracts/).

#### Contract()

**ConId:** int. Identifier to specify an exact contract.

**Symbol:** String. Ticker symbol of the underlying instrument.

**SecType:** String. Security type of the traded instrument.

**Exchange:** String. Exchange for which data or trades should be routed.

**PrimaryExchange:** String. Primary listing exchange of the instrument.

**Currency:** String. Base currency the instrument is traded on.

**LastTradeDateOrContractMonth:** String. For derivatives, the expiration date of the contract.

**Strike:** double. For derivatives, the strike price of the instrument.

**Right:** String. For derivatives, the right (P/C) of the instrument.

**TradingClass:** String. For derivatives, the trading class of the instrument.
 May be used to indicate between a monthly or a weekly contract.

Given additional structures for contracts are ever evolving, it is  recommended to review the relevant Contract class in your programming  language for a comprehensive review of what fields are available.

 [Contract Class Reference](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#contract-ref)

### Finding Contract Details in Trader WorkstationCopy Location

If there is more than one contract matching the same description, TWS will return an error notifying you there is an ambiguity. In these cases the TWS needs further information to narrow down the list of contracts  matching the provided description to a single element.

The best  way of finding a contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s description is within TWS itself. Within  TWS, you can easily check a contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s description either by double  clicking it or through the Financial Instrument Info -> Description  menu, which you access by right-clicking a contract in TWS:

![Right click menu containing Financial Instrument Info.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/financial_instr-description.png)



The description will then appear:

Note: you can see the extended contract details by choosing Contract Info  -> Details. This option will open a web page showing all available  information on the contract.

![Contract Description Window](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/contract_description.png)



Whenever a contract description is provided via the TWS API, the TWS will try to match the given description to a single contract. This mechanism allows for great flexibility since it gives the possibility to define the same contract in multiple ways.

The simplest way to define a contract  is by providing its symbol, security type, currency, exchange, and  primary exchange. The vast majority of stocks, CFDs, Indexes or FX pairs can be uniquely defined through these four attributes. More complex  contracts such as options and futures require some extra information due to their nature. Below are several examples for different types of  instruments.

### Contract DetailsCopy Location

Complete details about a contract in IBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s database can be retrieved using the function [IBApi.EClient.reqContractDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-contract-details). This includes information about a contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s conID, symbol, local  symbol, currency, etc. which is returned in a IBApi.ContractDetails  object. reqContractDetails takes as an argument a Contract object which  may uniquely match one contract, and unlike other API functions it can  also take a Contract object which matches multiple contracts in IBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s  database. When there are multiple matches, they will each be returned  individually to the function[ IBApi::EWrapper::contractDetails.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#receive-contract-details)

Request for Bond details will be returned to [IBApi::EWrapper::bondContractDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#receive-bond-details) instead. Because of bond market data license restrictions, there are  only a few available fields to be returned in a bond contract  description, namely the minTick, exchange, and short name.

Note:  Invoking reqContractDetails with a Contract object which has currency =  USD will only return US contracts, even if there are non-US instruments  which have the USD currency.

Another function of IBApi::EClient::reqContractDetails is to request the  trading schedule of an instrument via the TradingHours and LiquidHours  fields. The corresponding timeZoneId field will then indicate the time  zone for the trading schedule of the instrument. TWS sends these  timeZoneId strings to the API from the schedule responses as-is, and may not exactly match the time zones displayed in the TWS contract  description.

Possible timeZoneId values are:

- Europe/Riga
- Australia/NSW
- Europe/Warsaw
- US/Pacific
- Europe/Tallinn
- Japan
- US/Eastern
- GB-Eire
- Africa/Johannesburg
- Israel
- Europe/Vilnius
- MET
- Europe/Helsinki
- US/Central
- Europe/Budapest
- Asia/Calcutta
- Hongkong
- Europe/Moscow
- GMT

### Option ChainsCopy Location

The option chain for a given security can be returned using the function [EClient.reqContractDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-contract-details). If an option contract is incompletely defined (for instance with the strike undefined) and used as an argument to [EClient.reqContractDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-contract-details), a list of all matching option contracts will be returned.

One limitation of this technique is that the return of option chains will  be throttled and take a longer time the more ambiguous the contract  definition. The function [EClient.reqSecDefOptParams](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-opt-chain) was introduced that does not have the throttling limitation.

- It is not recommended to use [EClient.reqContractDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-contract-details) to receive complete option chains on an underlying, e.g. all combinations of strikes/rights/expiries.
- For very large option chains returned from [EClient.reqContractDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-contract-details), unchecking the setting in TWS Global Configuration at API ->  Settings -> ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Expose entire trading schedule to the APIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â will decrease the amount of data returned per option and help to return the contract  list more quickly.

[EClient.reqSecDefOptParams](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-opt-chain) returns a list of expiries and a list of strike prices. In some cases,  it is possible there are combinations of strike and expiry that would  not give a valid option contract.

## Event TradingCopy Location

Forecast and Event Contracts enable investors to trade their opinion on specific yes-or-no questions on economic indicators such as the Consumer Price  Index and the Fed Funds Rate, climate indicators including temperatures  and atmospheric CO2, key futures markets including energy, metals, and  equity indexes.

### IntroductionCopy Location

Interactive Brokers models Event Contract instruments on options (for ForecastEx  products) and futures options (for CME Group products).

Event  Contracts can generally be thought of as options products in the TWS  API, and their discovery workflow follows a familiar options-like  sequence. This guide will make analogies to conventional index options  for both ForecastEx and CME Group products.

### ForecastEx Forecast ContractsCopy Location

Forecast Contracts let you trade your view on the outcomes of various economic,  government and environmental indicators, elections and tight races.

Each contract pays USD 1.00 at expiry if expiring in-the-money, and your max profit per contract is USD 1.00 minus the premium you paid to purchase  the contract. Forecast Contracts are quoted in USD 0.01 increments.

ForecastEx Website: https://forecastex.com/

### CME Event ContractsCopy Location

CME event contracts let you trade your view on whether the price of key  futures markets will move up or down by the end of each dayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s trading  session.

Each contract pays USD 100.00 at expiry if expiring  in-the-money, and your max profit per contract is USD 100.00 minus the  premium you paid to purchase the contract (plus fees and commissions).  CME event contracts are quoted in USD 1.00 increments.

### Contract Definition & DiscoveryCopy Location

IBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Event Contract instrument records use the following fields inherited from the options model:

- An

  underlier

  , which may or may not be artificial:

  - For **CME products**, a tradable Event Contract will have the relevant CME future as its  underlier. Therefore, the security type of the CME contract will be a  futures option, or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“FOPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.
  - For **ForecastEx products**, IB has generated an artificial underlying index which serves as a  container for related Event Contracts in the same product class. These  artificial indices do not have any associated reference values and are  purely an artifact of the option instrument model used to represent  these Event Contracts. However, these artificial underlying indices can  be used to search for groups of related Event Contracts, just as with  index options. Therefore, the security type of ForecastEx products are  always options, or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“OPTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

- An

  Exchange

   value will reflect the listing exchange of the given Event contract.

  - ForecastEx contracts will always use ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“FORECASTXÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â as the exchange value. Note the  value does not include the final ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“EÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â in ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ForecastExÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.
  - A CME product may use ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“CBOTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“CMEÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“COMEXÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“NYMEXÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â depending on the contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s listing.

- A **Symbol** value which matches the symbol of the underlier, and which reflects the issuerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s product code.

- A

  Trading Class

   which also reflects the issuerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s product code for the instrument, and in the  case of CME Group products, is used to differentiate Event Contracts  from CME futures options.

  - Note that many CME Group Event Contracts, which resolve against CME Group  futures, are assigned a Trading Class prefixed with ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ECÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and followed by the symbol of the relevant futures product, to avoid naming collisions  with other derivatives (i.e., proper futures options listed on the same  future).

- A

  Put or Call (Right)

   value, where Call = Yes and Put = No.

  - Note that ForecastEx instruments do not permit Sell orders. Instead,  ForecastEx positions are flattened or reduced by buying the opposing  contract. CME Group Event Contracts permit both buying and selling.

- An artificial

  Contract Month

   value, again used primarily for searching and filtering available instruments. Most Event Contract products do not follow monthly series as is common  with index or equity options, so these Contract Month values are  typically not a meaningful attribute of the instrument. Rather, they  permit filtering of instruments by calendar month.

  - Requesting Contract Details for a given instrument will return a  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“realExpirationDateÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, which will correspond with the same values printed in the ForecastTrader page.

- A **Last Trade Date, Time, and Millisecond** values, which together indicate precisely when trading in an Event Contract will cease, just as with index options.

- A **Strike** value, which is the numerical value on which the event resolution hinges.  Though numerical, this value need not represent a price.

- An

  instrument description (or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“local symbolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â)

   in the form

  ```
  "PRODUCT EXPIRATION STRIKE RIGHT"
  ```

  , where:

  - `PRODUCT` is the issuerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s product identifier
  - `EXPIRATION` is the date of the instrumentÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s resolution in the form `MmmDD'YY`, e.g., ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sep26ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢24ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â
  - `STRIKE` is the numerical value that determines the contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s moneyness at expiration
  - `RIGHT` is a value YES or NO

### ForecastEx Contract ExampleCopy Location

Given the information above, we can establish a working example against the Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions contract on the [ForecastTrader Website](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/eventtrader/#/markets).

Reviewing the page to the right, we can see all of the contract details necessary to get started.

1. Above the chart next to the contract name, we can see the Symbol, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“GCEÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.
2. On the left side of the web page, we can find the contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s expiration date, June 30, 2026.
3. Equally important is the value on the right, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Market closes in 287 days.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â
4. The bolded excess on the top, 40,5000, indicates our strike price. This can be corroborated by the table on the left which acts like an Option  Chain table users may be more familiar with.

While not explicitly stated in the web page, there are several details that may be inferred based on the information present:

1. All ForecastEx contracts use the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“OPTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â security type, as mentioned in the [Contract Definition & Discovery](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#ec-contracts) section above.
2. The ForecastEx exchange value is always listed as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“FORECASTXÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.
3. All currently offered Event Contracts are hosted in the United States of  America, and therefore will always use ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“USDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â as their currency value.
4. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“YesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“NoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â contracts are based on option rights, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“CallÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“PutÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â respectively.



![Displays an example of a Forecast Contract being shown in the Forecast Trader.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/forecasttrader_gce.png)



In order to request our specific contract, we will need to focus on the  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Market closes in 287 daysÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â statement. This value indicates the last day the contract may be traded.

This document is written on the 19th of March, 2025. That is the 78th day of the calendar year.

Given the context that this is day 78, and the market will close in 287 days, the contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s last trade date would then be the 365th day of the year, or December 31st, 2025.

Given the TWS API date standards, this will be written as 20251231.


This information can now be distilled into a standard TWS API contract definition:

### Market DataCopy Location

Requesting market data for event contracts will follow the same request structure as for any other security type.

Noted in our [Contract Definition & Discovery](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#ec-contracts) section, ForecastEx instruments do not support buying and selling.  Therefore, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“BIDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ASKÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â values will not correlate to buy and sell  values, but the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Highest BidÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Buy **Yes** Now atÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â prices for the Bid and Ask respectively.

### Order SubmissionCopy Location

Order Submission for Event Contracts function the same as any other instrument offered at Interactive Brokers.

There are some unique order behaviors for both CME Group and ForecastEx contracts:

- Event Contracts only support Limit Orders
- Event Contracts only support a Time in Force of Day, Good till Canceled, or Immediate-Or-Cancel.
- Event Contracts do not support Cash Quantity in the TWS API. Orders must be submitted as whole-share values.
- CME Group instruments can be bought and sold and function as normal futures options.
- ForecastEx instruments cannot be sold, only bought. To exit or reduce a position,  one must buy the opposing Event Contract, and IB will net the opposing  positions together automatically.

**Event Contracts cannot be sold short.**


### Order ExampleCopy Location

Reviewing the same material as our [Contract Example](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#ec-contract-example), we have all the tools needed to submit our order with some additional  context available in the Order Ticket, featured on the right.

We are already aware that:

- ForecastEx contracts are always ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“BUYÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â orders.
- Event Contracts only support ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“LMTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â as the Order Type.

This leaves us to decide the quantity, limit price, and time-in-force values.

We can set our limit price based on the values shown in the Order Ticket, or base the value on the Bid and Ask Price from our [Requested Market Data](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#ec-market-data).

### Other FunctionalityCopy Location

- Event Contracts fundamentally behave like Options or Futures Options. As a  result, instrument rules, position information, and instrument-specific  behavior will follow the same presentation in the Trader Workstation as  those other instruments.
- Market Scanners are not currently  available to research Event Contracts. Users will need to discover Event Contract symbols through [Interactive BrokersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ ForecastTrader](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php).



## Error HandlingCopy Location

When a client application sends a message to TWS which requires a response  which has an expected response (i.e. placing an order, requesting market data, subscribing to account updates, etc.), TWS will almost either  always 1) respond with the relevant data or 2) send an error message to [EWrapper.error()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#error).

- **Exceptions when no response can occur**: Also, if a request is made prior to full establishment of connection (denoted by a returned 2104 or 2106 error code *ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Data Server is OkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â*), there may not be a response from the request.

Error messages sent by the TWS are handled by the [EWrapper.error()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#error) method. The [EWrapper.error()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#error) event contains the originating request Id (or the orderId in case the  error was raised when placing an order), a numeric error code and a  brief description. It is important to keep in mind that this function is used for *true* error messages as well as notifications that do not mean anything is wrong.

**API Error Messages when TWS is not set to the English Language**

- Currently on the Windows platform, error messages are sent using Latin1 encoding. If TWS is launched in a non-Western language, it is recommended to  enable the setting at Global Configuration -> API -> Settings to  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Show API error messages in EnglishÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

### Understanding Message CodesCopy Location

The TWS uses the [EWrapper.error](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#error) method not only to deliver errors but also warnings or informative messages.  This is done mostly for simplicityÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s sake. Below is a table with all the messages which can be sent by the TWS/IB Gateway. All messages  delivered by the TWS are usually accompanied by a brief but meaningful  description pointing in the direction of the problem.

Remember  that the TWS API simply connects to a running TWS/IB Gateway which most  of times will be running on your local network if not in the same host  as the client application. It is your responsibility to provide reliable connectivity between the TWS and your client application.

### System Message CodesCopy Location

The messages in the table below are not a consequence of any action  performed by the client application. They are notifications about the  connectivity status between the TWS and our servers. Your client  application must pay special attention to them and handle the situation  accordingly. You are very likely to lose connectivity to our servers at  least once a day due to our daily server maintenance downtime as clearly detailed in our Current System Status page. Note that after the system  reset, the TWS/IB Gateway will automatically reconnect to our servers  and you can resume your operations normally.



**Note:**

1. During a reset period, there may be an interruption in the ability to log in  or manage orders. Existing orders (native types) will operate normally  although execution reports and simulated orders will be delayed until  the reset is complete. It is not recommended to operate during the  scheduled reset times.

### Common Error ResolutionCopy Location

The content below references some of the most common errors received by  clients at Interactive Brokers, and offers direct resolutions for the  matters in most instances. If further information is required, please  feel to contact [Customer Service](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/support/customer-service.php?p=contact) for additional insight.


### Market data farm connection is OKCopy Location

Error code 2104, 2106, and 2158 all generally state that farm connection is  OK. What this means is that the API has successfully connected to Trader Workstation or the IB Gateway, and that connection is able to reach  Interactive Brokers servers. There is no issue with the connection, and  it is a sign you connected successfully.

While using IB Gateway,  users may encounter the error, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“A historical data farm connection has  become inactive but should be available upon demand.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â This means that  while no historical data requests are being sent, the connection is  halted. Once a historical data request is sent over the API connection,  the market data farm will reconnect and supply market data.

### Requested market data requires additional subscription for API. See link in  'Market Data Connections' dialog for more details.Delayed market data is available.Copy Location

Error 10089 notes that clients are requesting market data when they do not  maintain a valid market data subscription. To resolve this issue, users  must add a market data subscription to [the specific user they are requesting market data with](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/market-data-subscriptions/#md-users). Alternatively, users must [request delayed market data](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#delayed-market-data) prior to requesting market data.

Market data availability is different in [TWS versus the API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/market-data-subscriptions/#tws-vs-api). As a result, market data you can receive in Trader Workstation may not be available in the API.

Interactive Brokers lists many of our most popular market data subscriptions [here](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/market-data-subscriptions/#popular-md-subscriptions).

## Financial AdvisorsCopy Location

**Note:**

In order to confirm that your FA changes were saved, you may wait for the [EWrapper.replaceFAEnd](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-methods-e-f/#receive-fa) callback, which provides the corresponding reqId. In addition, after  saving changes, it is advised to verify the new FA setup via [EClient.requestFA](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-methods-e-f/#request-fa). If it is called before changes are fully saved, you may receive an error, such as [error 10230](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#api-error-codes). See [Message Codes](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#api-error-codes).



[EClient.replaceFA](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#replace-fa) only accepts faDataType 1 now. Otherwise, it may trigger [error 585](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#api-error-codes).

### Allocation Methods and GroupsCopy Location

A number of methods for account allocations are available with Financial  Advisor and IBroker account structures to specify how trades should be  distributed across multiple accounts.

Allocation Groups can be created or modified in the Trader Workstation directly as described in [TWS: Allocations and Transfers](https://www.ibkrguides.com/tws/usersguidebook/financialadvisors/create an account group for share allocation.htm).

Alternatively, allocation groups can be created or modified through the [EClient.replaceFA()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#replace-fa) method in the API.

Interactive Brokers supports two forms of allocation methods. Allocation methods  that have calculations completed by Interactive Brokers, and a set of  allocation methods calculated by the user and then specified.

#### IB-computed allocation methods

- [Available Equity](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#available-equity-xml)
- [Equal Quantity](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#equal-quantity-xml)
- [Net Liquidation Value](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#nlv-xml)

#### User-specified allocation methods

###### Formerly known as Allocation Profiles

- [Cash Quantity](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#cash-xml)
- [Percentages](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#percentage-xml)

Allocation methods for financial advisorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s allocation groups are created using an  XML format. The content below signifies the supported allocation groups  and how to format them in their respective XML.

### Available EquityCopy Location

Requires you to specify an order size. This method distributes shares based on  the amount of available equity in each account. The system calculates  ratios based on the Available Equity in each account and allocates  shares based on these ratios.



**Example:**  You transmit an order for 700 shares of stock XYZ. The account group  includes three accounts, A, B and C with available equity in the amounts of $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000 respectively. The system calculates a  ratio of 1:2:4 and allocates 100 shares to Client A, 200 shares to  Client B, and 400 shares to Client C.

### Contracts Or SharesCopy Location

This method allocates the absolute number of shares you enter to each  account listed. If you use this method, the order size is calculated by  adding together the number of shares allocated to each account in the  profile.



**Example:**

Assume an order for 300 shares of stock ABC is transmitted.

In the example code shown in the right side, you can see that:

1. Account A is set to receive 100.0 shares while Account B is set to receive  200.0 shares. Account A should receive 100 shares and Account B should  receive 200 shares.

### Equal QuantityCopy Location

Requires you to specify an order size. This method distributes shares equally between all accounts in the group.



**Example:** You transmit an order for 400 shares of stock ABC. If your Account  Group includes four accounts, each account receives 100 shares. If your  Account Group includes six accounts, each account receives 66 shares,  and then 1 share is allocated to each account until all are distributed.

### Net Liquidation ValueCopy Location

Requires you to specify an order size. This method distributes shares based on  the net liquidation value of each account. The system calculates ratios  based on the Net Liquidation value in each account and allocates shares  based on these ratios.



**Example:** You  transmit an order for 700 shares of stock XYZ. The account group  includes three accounts, A, B and C with Net Liquidation values of  $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000 respectively.

### PercentagesCopy Location

This method will split the total number of shares in the order between listed accounts based on the percentages you indicate.



**Example:**

Assume an order for 300 shares of stock ABC is transmitted.

In the example code shown in the right side, you can see that:

1. Account A is set to have 60.0 percentage while Account B is set to have 40.0  percentage. Account A should receive 180 shares and Account B should  receive 120 shares.



While making modifications to  allocations for profiles, the method uses an enumerated value. The  number shown below demonstrates precisely what profile corresponds to  which value.

| **BUY ORDER**  | *Positive Percent* | *Negative Percent* |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Long Position  | Increases position | No effect          |
| Short Position | No effect          | Decreases position |

| **SELL ORDER** | *Positive Percent* | *Negative Percent* |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Long Position  | No effect          | Decreases position |
| Short Position | Increases position | No effect          |



**Note:**
 Do not specify an order size. Since the quantity is calculated by the  system, the order size is displayed in the Quantity field after the  order is acknowledged. This method increases or decreases an already  existing position. Positive percents will increase a position, negative  percents will decrease a position. For exmaple, to fully close out a  position, you just need to specify percentage to be -100.

### Model Portfolios and the APICopy Location

Advisors can use Model Portfolios to easily invest some or all of a clientÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s  assets into one or multiple custom-created portfolios, rather than  tediously managing individual investments in single instruments.

[More about Model Portfolios](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=20917)

The TWS API can access model portfolios in accounts where this  functionality is available and a specific model has previously been  setup in TWS. API functionality allows the client application to request model position update subscriptions, request model account update  subscriptions, or place orders to a specific model.

Model Portfolio functionality **not** available in the TWS API:

- Portfolio Model Creation
- Portfolio Model Rebalancing
- Portfolio Model Position or Cash Transfer

To request position updates from a specific model, the function [IBApi::EClient::reqPositionsMulti](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#request-positions-multi) can be used: [Position Update Subscription by Model](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#positions-multi)

To request model account updates, there is the function [IBApi::EClient::reqAccountUpdatesMulti](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#request-model-account-update), see: [Account Value Update Subscriptions by Model](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#model-account-update)

To place an order to a model, the IBApi.Order.ModelCode field must be set accordingly, for example:

-

modelOrder = Order()

modelOrder.account = "DF12345"

modelOrder.modelCode = "Technology" # model for tech stocks first created in TWS

self.placeOrder(self.nextOrderId(), contract, modelOrder)



### Unification of Groups and ProfilesCopy Location

With TWS/IBGW build 983+, the API settings will have a new flag/checkbox, **ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Use Account Groups with Allocation MethodsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â** (enabled by default for new users). If not enabled, groups and profiles would  behave the same as before. If it is checked, group and profile  functionality will be merged.

With TWS/IBGW Build 10.20+, this  setting is now enabled by default, and moving forward into new versions, the two systems can be deemed as interchangeable for modifying  allocation groups, placing orders, requesting account or portfolio  summaries, or requesting multiple positions.

### Order PlacementCopy Location

For advisors to place orders to their [allocation groups](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#replace-fa) users would simply declare their allocation group name in the order  object. This would be done with the OrderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s faGroup field. The example  to the right references a standard market order placed to our allocation group, MyTestProfile.

-

order = Order()

order.action = "BUY"

order.orderType = "MKT"

order.totalQuantity = 50

order.faGroup = "MyTestProfile"



## Market Data: DelayedCopy Location

Delayed market data can **only** be used with [EClient.reqMktData](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#watchlist-data) and [ EClient.reqHistoricalData](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#historical-bars). This does not function for tick data.

The API can request Live, Frozen, Delayed and Delayed Frozen market data  from Trader Workstation by switching market data type via the [EClient.reqMarketDataType](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-md-type) before making a market data request. A successful switch to a different (non-live) market data type for a particular market data request will  be indicated by a callback to [EWrapper.marketDataType](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#receive-md-type) with the ticker ID of the market data request which is returning a different type of data.

- A [EClient.reqMarketDataType](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-md-type) callback of **1** will occur automatically after invoking reqMktData if the user has live data permissions for the instrument.

| Market Data Type | ID   | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Live             | 1    | Live market data is streaming data relayed back in real time. Market data  subscriptions are required to receive live market data. |
| Frozen           | 2    | Frozen market data is the last data recorded at market close. In TWS, Frozen  data is displayed in gray numbers. When you set the market data type to  Frozen, you are asking TWS to send the last available quote when there  is not one currently available. For instance, if a market is currently  closed and real time data is requested, -1 values will commonly be  returned for the bid and ask prices to indicate there is no current  bid/ask data available. TWS will often show a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œfrozenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ bid/ask which  represents the last value recorded by the system. To receive the last  know bid/ask price before the market close, switch to market data type 2 from the API before requesting market data. API frozen data requires  TWS/IBG v.962 or higher and the same market data subscriptions necessary for real time streaming data. |
| Delayed          | 3    | Free, delayed data is 15 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 20 minutes delayed. In TWS, delayed data is  displayed in brown background. When you set market data type to delayed, you are telling TWS to automatically switch to delayed market data if  the user does not have the necessary real time data subscription. If  live data is available a request for delayed data would be ignored by  TWS. Delayed market data is returned with delayed [Tick Types](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#available-tick-types) (Tick ID 66~76). |
| Delayed Frozen   | 4    | Requests delayed ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“frozenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â data for a user without market data subscriptions. |

### Market Data Type BehaviorCopy Location

1) If user sends reqMarketDataType(1) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ TWS will start sending only regular (1) market data.
2) If user sends reqMarketDataType(2) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ frozen, TWS will start sending  regular (1) as default and frozen (2) market data. TWS sends  marketDataType callback (1 or 2) indicating what market data will be  sent after this callback. It can be regular or frozen.
3) If user sends reqMarketDataType(3) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ delayed, TWS will start sending regular (1) as default and delayed (3) market data.
4) If user sends reqMarketDataType(4) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ delayed-frozen, TWS will start  sending regular (1) as default, delayed (3) and delayed-frozen (4)  market data.

Interactive Brokers data will always try to provide  the most up to date market data possible, but will permit additional  delayed or frozen data if available upon request.

### Request Market Data TypeCopy Location

#### EClient.reqMarketDataType (

**marketDataType:** int. Type of market data to retrieve.

## Market Data: HistoricalCopy Location

Historical Market data is available for Interactive Brokers market data  subscribers in a range of methods and structures. This includes requests for historical bars, identical to the Trader Workstation, historical  Time & Sales, as well as Histogram data.

### Historical Data LimitationsCopy Location

Historical market data has itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s own set of market data limitations unique to other requests such as real time market data. This section will cover all  limitations that effect historical market data in the Trader Workstation API.

### Historical Data FilteringCopy Location

Historical data at IB is filtered for trade types which occur away from the NBBO  such as combo legs, block trades, and derivative trades. For that reason the daily volume from the (unfiltered) real time data functionality  will generally be larger than the (filtered) historical volume reported  by historical data functionality. Also, differences are expected in  other fields such as the VWAP between the real time and historical data  feeds.



As historical data at IB gets adjusted, compressed  and filtered by default, there may be historical data differences if you request historical data at different time points.

### Historical Volume ScalingCopy Location

Volume data returned for historical bars can be modified to return in shares or lots.

1. Open the Global Configuration window
2. Navigate to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“APIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and then ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“SettingsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â on the left pane
3. Scroll down to the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Send market data in lots for US Stocks for dual-mode API clientsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â

If the setting is checked, historical volume data will return as a [Round Lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roundlot.asp).

If the setting is unchecked, historical volume data will return in Shares.

![Send market data in lots for US stocks for dual-mode API clients highlighted in API Settings.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/hist_volume_modifier.png)



### Pacing Violations for Small Bars (30 secs or less)Copy Location

Although Interactive Brokers offers our clients high quality market data, IB is  not a specialised market data provider and as such it is forced to put  in place restrictions to limit traffic which is not directly associated  to trading. A Pacing Violation occurs whenever one or more of the  following restrictions is not observed:

Important: these  limitations apply to all our clients and it is not possible to overcome  them. If your trading strategyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s market data requirements are not met by our market data services please consider contacting a specialized  provider.



- Making identical historical data requests within 15 seconds.
- Making six or more historical data requests for the same Contract, Exchange and Tick Type within two seconds.
- Making more than 60 requests within any ten minute period.
- Note that when BID_ASK historical data is requested, each request is counted twice. In a nutshell, the information above can simply be put as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“do  not request too much data too quickÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

### Unavailable Historical DataCopy Location

The other historical data limitations listed are general limitations for all trading platforms:

- Bars whose size is 30 seconds or less older than six months
- Expired futures data older than two years counting from the futureÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s expiration date.
- Expired options, FOPs, warrants and structured products.
- End of Day (EOD) data for options, FOPs, warrants and structured products.
- Data for expired future spreads
- Data for securities which are no longer trading.
- Native historical data for combos. Historical data is not stored in the IB  database separately for combos.; combo historical data in TWS or the API is the sum of data from the legs.
- Historical data for  securities which move to a new exchange will often not be available  prior to the time of the move. For example, SOXX stock moved to NASDAQ  exchange on 15 Oct 2010, so no SOXX data before 15 Oct 2010 can be  retrieved despite SOXX was listed in 2001. This limitation also applied  to contract which specifies `SMART` as the exchange.
- Studies and indicators such as Weighted Moving Averages or Bollinger Bands are not available from the API.

### Finding the Earliest Available Data PointCopy Location

For many functions, such as EClient.reqHistoricalData, you will need to  request market data for a contract. Given that you may not know how long a symbol has been available, you can use EClient.reqHeadTimestamp to  find the first available point of data for a given whatToShow value.

ReqHeadTimeStamp counts as an ongoing historical data request, similar to using  EClient.reqHistoricalDataÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s keepUpToDate=True flag. As a result, users  should always:

- Cancel timestamp requests using [EClient.cancelHeadTimeStamp](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#cancelling-earliest-data).
- All EClient.reqHeadTimestamp requests follow the [30 second bar limitations](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#historical-pacing-limitations), regardless of which bar size value has been requested.

### DurationCopy Location

The Interactive Brokers Historical Market Data maintains a duration  parameter which specifies the overall length of time that data can be  collected. The duration specified will derive the bars of data that can  then be collected.

#### Valid Duration String Units:

| Unit | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| S    | Seconds     |
| D    | Day         |
| W    | Week        |
| M    | Month       |
| Y    | Year        |



### Historical Bar SizesCopy Location

Bar sizes dictate the data returned by historical bar requests. The bar  size will dictate the scale over which the OHLC/V is returned to the  API.

#### Valid Bar Sizes:

| Bar Unit | Bar Sizes                  |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| secs     | 1, 5, 10, 15, 30           |
| mins     | 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 |
| hours    | 1, 2, 3, 4, 8              |
| day      | 1                          |
| weeks    | 1                          |
| months   | 1                          |



### Step SizesCopy Location

The functionality of market data requests are predicated on preset step  sizes. As such, not all bar sizes will work with all duration values.  The table listed here will discuss the smallest to largest bar size  value for each duration string.

| Duration Unit | Bar units allowed   | Bar size Interval (Min/Max) |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| S             | secs \| mins        | 1 secs -> 1mins             |
| D             | secs \| mins \| hrs | 5 secs -> 1 hours           |
| W             | sec \| mins \| hrs  | 10 secs -> 4 hrs            |
| M             | sec \| mins \| hrs  | 30 secs -> 8 hrs            |
| Y             | mins \| hrs  \| d   | 1 mins-> 1 day              |

### Max Duration Per Bar SizeCopy Location

The table below displays the maximum duration values allowed for a given bar.

As an example, the maximum duration for Seconds values supported for 5  seconds bars are 86400 S. This means that if I want to retrieve more  than 1 dayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s worth of 5 second bars, I will then need to request data in increments of D (days).

| Bar Size | Max Second Duration | Max Day Duration | Max Week Duration | Max Month Duration | Max Year Duration |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 secs   | 2000 S              | {Not Supported}  | {Not Supported}   | {Not Supported}    | {Not Supported}   |

### Format Date ReceivedCopy Location

Interactive Brokers will return historical market data based on the format set from the request. The formatDate parameter can be provided an integer value  to indicate how data should be returned.

**Note:** Day bars will only return dates in the yyyyMMdd format. Time data is not available.

| Value | Description           | Example                              |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1     | String Time Zone Date | ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“20231019 16:11:48 America/New_YorkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â |
| 2     | Epoch Date            | 1697746308                           |
| 3     | Day & Time Date       | ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“1019 16:11:48 America/New_YorkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â     |

### Keep Up To DateCopy Location

When using keepUpToDate=True for historical data requests, you will see  several bars returned with the same timestamp. This is because data is  updated approximately every 1-2 seconds. These updates compound until  the end of the specified bar size.

In our example to the below, 15 second bars are requested, and we can see the 30 second bar built out  incrementally until 20231204 13:30:30 is completed. At which point, we  move on to the 45th second bars. This same logic extends into minute,  hourly, or daily bars.

##### Note:

keepUpToDate is only available for whatToShow: Trades, Midpoint, Bid, Ask

### Histogram DataCopy Location

Instead of returned data points as a function of time as with the function  IBApi::EClient::reqHistoricalData, histograms return data as a function  of price level with function IBApi::EClient::reqHistogramData

### Requesting Histogram DataCopy Location

#### EClient.reqHistogramData (

**requestId:** int, id of the request

**contract:** Contract, Contract object that is subject of query.

**useRth:** bool, Data from regular trading hours (1), or all available hours (0).

### Historical Time & SalesCopy Location

The highest granularity of historical data from IBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s database can be retrieved using the API function [EClient.reqHistoricalTicks](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#requesting-time-and-sales) for historical time and sales values. Historical Time & Sales will  return the same data as what is available in Trader Workstation under  the Time and Sales window. This is a series of ticks indicating each  trade based on the requested values.

- Historical Tick-By-Tick data is not available for combos.
- Data will not be returned from multiple trading sessions in a single request; Multiple requests must be used.
- To complete a full second, more ticks may be returned than requested.
- Time & Sales data requires a Level 1, Top Of Book market data subscription. This would be the same subscription as [EClient.reqMktData()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#watchlist-data) or [EClient.reqHistoricalData()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#historical-bars).

### Historical Halted and Unhalted ticksCopy Location

The tick attribute pastLimit is also returned with streaming Tick-By-Tick responses. Check Halted and Unhalted ticks section.

- If tick has zero price, zero size and pastLimit flag is set ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ this is ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“HaltedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â tick.

### Historical Date FormattingCopy Location

When creating dates in the TWS API, Interactive Brokers typically supports three methods:

1. [Operator Time Zone](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#operator-tz)
2. [Exchange Time Zone](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#exchange-tz)
3. [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#utc-tz)

### Operator Time ZoneCopy Location

Operator Time Zone is the local time set by the user in Trader Workstation. The  Operator Time Zone typically maintains a unique formatting structure  separate from Exchange Time Zones; however, they can match.

A user can confirm their Operator Time Zone by launching Trader Workstation then, before logging in, click ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“More Options >ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

![More Options button on the TWS login window. ](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/twsLogin-700x407.png)



Users can then confirm their active Operator Time Zone by referencing the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time ZoneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â field.

For US residents, this will typically appear as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“America/New_YorkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â,  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“America/ChicagoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“America/Los_AngelesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. It is essential to note the Time Zone value, as this will be the value supplied when making  requests with the Operator Time Zone.

![More Options settings on the TWS login window.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/twsMoreOptions-1-700x406.png)



After logging in to Trader Workstation or IB Gateway, you would be able to  submit time stamps in the format of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“YYYYMMDD HH:mm:ss  Operator/Time_ZoneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

Given our prior example, a historical data  endDateTime value would appear asÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â20250101 23:59:59 America/ChicagoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.  This would mean the latest value I want is just before midnight in  Chicago on January 1st, 2025. Even if I am trading contracts in New York or overseas, all historical data requests would be relative to my own  time zone.

### Exchange Time ZoneCopy Location

The exchange Time Zone is the value the exchange itself uses to calculate  time. This value is typically unique to the Operator Time Zone, but  these values can overlap.

As an example, the New York Stock Exchange operates on ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“US/EasternÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.  However, the CME operates on ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“US/CentralÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. This values can be  programmatically requested using the EClient.reqContractDetails method,  and then received from EWrapper.contractDetails in contractDetails.Time  ZoneId.

Note that this will be interpreted differently from ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“America/ChicagoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

![Time Zone response from a reqContractDetails request.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/exchangeTimeZone.png)



### Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)Copy Location

UTC is a time standard centered around Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC  historical data can be formatted as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“YYYYMMDD-hh:mm:ssÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. Please keep in  mind this is based on UTC+0, and as a reference, US/Eastern time is  approximately UTC-4 or UTC-5 depending on U.S. Daylight savings.

Please note GMT is unaffected by Daylight savings, and so 09:00:00 will be the same time of day year round regardless of the exchangeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s or your local  daylight savings observation.

### Modifying Returned DateCopy Location

You may also log in to the Trader Workstation and modify this in the Global Configuration under API and then Settings. Here, you will find a  modifiable setting labeled ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Send instrument-specific attributes for  dual-mode API client inÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â Here you can select one of the following:

- operator timezone: refers to the local timezone you have set in the Trader Workstation or IB Gateway
- instrument timezone: refers to the timezone of the requested exchange. If ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“SMARTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  is used, this will use the instrumentÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s primary exchange.
- UTC format: refers to a standardized return using UTC as the timezone. This will be returned in the format YYYYMMDD-hh:mm:ss

## Market Data: LiveCopy Location

### Live Data LimitationsCopy Location

For all data, besides [Delayed Watchlist Data](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#delayed-market-data), a paid data subscription is required to receive market data through the API. See the [Market Data Subscriptions](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/market-data-subscriptions/) page for more information.

- Live market data and historical bars are currently not available from the API for the exchange **OSE**. Only 15 minute delayed streaming data will be available for this exchange.
- Some [Available Tick Types](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#available-tick-types) may not be provided due to the contract details, the time that you run  the codeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ ,etc. To verify whether the specific Available Tick Type is  provided, it is suggested to manually check the data in TWS.
- Different [Available Tick Types](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#available-tick-types) have different updating frequency.

The bid, ask, and last size quotes are displayed in shares instead of lots.

API users have the option to configure the TWS API to work in compatibility mode for older programs, but we recommend migrating to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“quotes in  sharesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â at your earliest convenience.

To display quotes as lots,  from the Global Configuration > API > Settings page, check ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bypass US Stocks market data in shares warning for API orders.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â

### 5 Second BarsCopy Location

Real time and historical data functionality is combined through the  EClient.reqRealTimeBars request. reqRealTimeBars will create an active  subscription that will return a single bar in real time every five  seconds that has the OHLC values over that period. reqRealTimeBars can  only be used with a bar size of 5 seconds.

**Important:** real time bars subscriptions combine the limitations of both, top and  historical market data. Make sure you observe Market Data Lines and [Pacing Violations for Small Bars (30 secs or less)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#historical-pacing-limitations). For example, no more than 60 ***new\*** requests for real time bars can be made in 10 minutes, and the total number of  active active subscriptions of all types cannot exceed the maximum  allowed market data lines for the user.

### Request Real Time BarsCopy Location

#### EClient.reqRealTimeBars (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**contract:** Contract. The Contract object for which the depth is being requested

**barSize:** int. Currently being ignored

**whatToShow:** String. The nature of the data being retrieved:
 Available Values: TRADES, MIDPOINT, BID, ASK

**useRTH:** int. Set to 0 to obtain the data which was also generated outside of  the Regular Trading Hours, set to 1 to obtain only the RTH data
 )

### Component ExchangesCopy Location

A single data request from the API can receive aggregate quotes from  multiple exchanges. The tick types ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œbidExchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ (tick type 32), ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œaskExchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢  (tick type 33), ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œlastExchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ (tick type 84) are used to identify the  source of a quote. To preserve bandwidth, the data returned to these  tick types consists of a sequence of capital letters rather than a long  list of exchange names for every returned exchange name field. To find  the full exchange name corresponding to a single letter code returned in tick types 32, 33, or 84, and API function IBApi::[EClient::reqSmartComponents](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#exchange-component-mapping) is available. Note: This function can only be used when the exchange is open.

Different IB contracts have a different exchange map containing the set of  exchanges on which they trade. Each exchange map has a different code,  such as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“a6ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“a9ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. This exchange mapping code is returned to [EWrapper.tickReqParams](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#exchange-component-mapping) immediately after a market data request is made by a user with market  data subscriptions. To find a particular map of single letter codes to  full exchange names, the function reqSmartComponents is invoked with the exchange mapping code returned to tickReqParams.

For instance, a market data request for the IBKR US contract may return the exchange mapping identifier ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“a6ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â to [EWrapper.tickReqParams](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#exchange-component-mapping) . Invoking the function [EClient.reqSmartComponents](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#exchange-component-mapping) with the symbol ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“a9ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â will reveal the list of exchanges offering market  data for the IBKR US contract, and their single letter codes.

In that case if ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â is returned to the exchange  tick types, that would indicate the quote was provided by ARCA.

Market depth data, also known as level II, represents an instrumentÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s order  book. Via the TWS API it is possible to obtain this information with the [EClient.reqMarketDepth](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-market-depth) function. Unlike [Top Market Data (Level I)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#watchlist-data), market depth data is sent without sampling nor filtering, however we  cannot guarantee that every price quoted for a particular security will  be displayed when you invoke [EClient.reqMarketDepth](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-market-depth).

In particular, odd lot orders are not included.

It is possible to Smart-route a [EClient.reqMarketDepth](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-market-depth) request to receive aggregated data from all available exchanges, similar to the TWS Market Depth window display.

An integral part of processing the incoming data is monitoring  EWrapper::error for message 317 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Market depth data has been RESET.  Please empty deep book contents before applying any new entries.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and  handling it appropriately, otherwise the update process would be  corrupted.

Market Depth is not support for Calendar Spreads or Combos.

MODEL_OPTION_COMPUTATION also returns model implied volatility.

Note that to receive live greek values it is necessary to have market data  subscriptions for both the option and the underlying contract.

The implied volatility for an option given its price and the price of the  underlying can be calculated with the function  EClient.calculateImpliedVolatility.

Alternatively, given the price of the underlying and an implied volatility it is possible to calculate the option price using the function EClient.calculateOptionPrice.

After the request, the option specific information will be delivered via the EWrapper.tickOptionComputation method.

### Top of Book (L1)Copy Location

Streaming market data values corresponding to data shown in TWS watchlists is  available via the EClient.reqMktData. This data is not tick-by-tick but  consists of aggregate snapshots taken several times per second. A set of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œdefaultÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ tick types are returned by default from a call to  EClient.reqMktData, and additional tick types are available by  specifying the corresponding generic tick type in the market data  request. Including the generic tick types many, but not all, types of  data are available that can be displayed in TWS watchlists by adding  additional columns.

Using the TWS API, you can request real time market data for trading and  analysis. From the API, market data returned from the  function IBApi.EClient.reqMktData corresponds to market data displayed  in TWS watchlists. This data is not tick-by-tick but consists of  aggregated snapshots taken at intra-second intervals which differ  depending on the type of instrument:

| Product                    | Frequency |
| -------------------------- | --------- |
| Stocks, Futures and others | 250 ms    |
| US Options                 | 100 ms    |
| FX pairs                   | 5 ms      |

#### EClient.reqMktData (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier for tracking data.

**contract:** Contract. Contract object used for specifying an instrument.

**[genericTickList](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#generic-tick-types):** String. Comma separated ids of the available generic ticks.

self.reqMktData(reqId, contract, "", False, False, [])



### Generic Tick TypesCopy Location

The most common tick types are delivered automatically after a successful  market data request. There are however other tick types available by  explicit request: the generic tick types. When invoking  IBApi.EClient.reqMktData, specific generic ticks can be requested via  the genericTickList parameter of the function:

See the [Available Tick Types](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#available-tick-types) section for more information on generic ticks.

### Streaming Data SnapshotsCopy Location

With an exchange market data subscription, such as Network A (NYSE), Network B(ARCA), or Network C(NASDAQ) for US stocks, it is possible to request a snapshot of the current state of the market once instead of requesting a stream of updates continuously as market values change. By invoking the EClient.reqMktData function passing in true for the snapshot parameter, the client application will receive the currently available market data once before a EWrapper.tickSnapshotEnd event is sent 11 seconds later.  Snapshot requests can only be made for the default tick types; no  generic ticks can be specified. It is important to note that a snapshot  request will only return available data over the 11 second span; in some cases values may not be returned for all tick types.

#### EWrapper.tickSnapshotEnd (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.
 )

When requesting market data snapshots, this market will indicate the  snapshot reception is finished. Expected to occur 11 seconds after  beginning of request.

-

def tickSnapshotEnd(self, reqId: int):

  print("TickSnapshotEnd. TickerId:", reqId)



### Regulatory SnapshotsCopy Location

The fifth argument to reqMktData specifies a regulatory snapshot request to US stocks and options.

For stocks, there are individual exchange-specific market data  subscriptions necessary to receive streaming quotes. For instance, for  NYSE stocks this subscription is known as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Network AÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, for ARCA/AMEX  stocks it is called ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Network BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and for NASDAQ stocks it is ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Network CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. Each subscription is added a la carte and has a separate market data  fee.

Alternatively, there is also a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“US Securities Snapshot  BundleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â subscription which does not provide streaming data but which  allows for real time calculated snapshots of US market NBBO prices. By  setting the 5th parameter in the function EClient::reqMktData to **True**, a regulatory snapshot request can be made from the API. The returned  value is a calculation of the current market state based on data from  all available exchanges.

**Important: Each regulatory snapshot made will incur a fee of 0.01 USD to the account. This applies to both live \*and\* paper accounts.**. If the monthly fee for regulatory snapshots reaches the price of a  particular ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œNetworkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ subscription, the user will automatically be  subscribed to that Network subscription for continuous streaming quotes  and charged the associated fee for that month. At the end of the month  the subscription will be terminated. Each listing exchange will be  capped independently and will not be combined across listing exchanges.

Requesting regulatory snapshots is subject to pacing limitations:

- No more than one request per second.

The following table lists the cost and maximum allocation for regulatory snapshot quotes:

| Listed Network Feed    | Price per reqSnapshot request | Pro or non-Pro | Max reqSnapshot request |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| NYSE (Network A/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Pro            | 4500                    |
| NYSE (Network A/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Non-Pro        | 150                     |
| AMEX (Network B/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Pro            | 2300                    |
| AMEX (Network B/CTA)   | 0.01 USD                      | Non-Pro        | 150                     |
| NASDAQ (Network C/UTP) | 0.01 USD                      | Pro            | 2300                    |
| NASDAQ (Network C/UTP) | 0.01 USD                      | Non-Pro        | 150                     |

### Receive Live DataCopy Location

**Note:** Please be aware that in the event subsequent orders are received with  the same price value, but different size values, no new tickPrice value  should be returned. Only an updated tickSize will denote that a new  order was retrieved with the assumption the last tickPrice value will  also correlate with the new size.

**attribs:** TickAttrib. A TickAttrib object that contains price attributes such as  TickAttrib::CanAutoExecute, TickAttrib::PastLimit and  TickAttrib::PreOpen.
 )

Market data tick price callback.  Handles all price related ticks. Every tickPrice callback is followed by a tickSize. A tickPrice value of -1 or 0 followed by a tickSize of 0  indicates there is no data for this field currently available, whereas a tickPrice with a positive tickSize indicates an active quote of 0  (typically for a combo contract).

-

def tickPrice(self, reqId: TickerId, tickType: TickType, price: float, attrib: TickAttrib):

  print(reqId, tickType, price, attrib)



#### EWrapper.tickSize (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**field:** int. the type of size being received (i.e. bid size)

**size:** int. the actual size. US stocks have a multiplier of 100.
 )

Market data tick size callback. Handles all size-related ticks.

-

def tickSize(self, reqId: TickerId, tickType: TickType, size: Decimal):

  print("TickSize. TickerId:", reqId, "TickType:", tickType, "Size: ", decimalMaxString(size))



#### EWrapper.tickString (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**field:** int. The type of the tick being received

**value:** String. Variable containining message response.
 )

Market data callback.

**Note:** Every tickPrice is followed by a tickSize. There are also independent  tickSize callbacks anytime the tickSize changes, and so there will be  duplicate tickSize messages following a tickPrice.

def tickString(self, reqId: TickerId, tickType: TickType, value: str):

  print("TickString. TickerId:", reqId, "Type:", tickType, "Value:", value)



### Exchange Component MappingCopy Location

A market data request is able to return data from multiple exchanges.  After a market data request is made for an instrument covered by market  data subscriptions, a message will be sent to function  IBApi::EWrapper::tickReqParams with information about ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œminTickÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, BBO  exchange mapping, and available snapshot permissions.

The exchange mapping identifier bboExchange will be a symbol such as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“a6ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â which can  be used to decode the single letter exchange abbreviations returned to  the bidExch, askExch, and lastExch fields by invoking the function  IBApi::EClient::reqSmartComponents. More information about Component  Exchanges.

The minTick returned to tickReqParams indicates the  minimum increment in market data values returned to the API. It can  differ from the minTick value in the ContractDetails class. For  instance, combos will often have a minimum increment of 0.01 for market  data and a minTick of 0.05 for order placement.

#### EWrapper.tickReqParams (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**minTick:** Minimum tick for the contract on the exchange.

**bboExchange:** String. Exchange offering the best bid offer.

**snapshotPermissions:** Based on the snapshot parameter in EClient.reqMktData.
 )

Displays the ticker with BBO exchange.

-

def tickReqParams(self, tickerId:int, minTick:float, bboExchange:str, snapshotPermissions:int):

  print("TickReqParams. TickerId:", tickerId, "MinTick:", floatMaxString(minTick), "BboExchange:", bboExchange, "SnapshotPermissions:", intMaxString(snapshotPermissions))



### Re-Routing CFDsCopy Location

IB does not provide market data for certain types of instruments, such as  stock CFDs and forex CFDs. If a stock CFD or forex CFD is entered into a TWS watchlist, TWS will automatically display market data for the  underlying ticker and show a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œUÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ icon next to the instrument name to  indicate that the data is for the underlying instrument.

From the  API, when level 1 or level 2 market data is requested for a stock CFD or a forex CFD, a callback is made to the functions  EWrapper.rerouteMktDataReq or EWrapper.rerouteMktDepthReq respectively  with details about the underlying instrument in IBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s database which does have market data.

#### EWrapper.rerouteMktDataReq (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**conId:** int. Contract identifier of the underlying instrument which has market data.

**exchange:** int. Primary exchange of the underlying.
 )

Returns conid and exchange for CFD market data request re-route.

-

def rerouteMktDataReq(self, reqId: int, conId: int, exchange: str):

  print("Re-route market data request. ReqId:", reqId, "ConId:", conId, "Exchange:", exchange)



#### EWrapper.rerouteMktDepthReq (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**conId:** int. Contract identifier of the underlying instrument which has market data.

**exchange:** int. Primary exchange of the underlying.
 )

Returns the conId and exchange for an underlying contract when a request is  made for level 2 data for an instrument which does not have data in IBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s database. For example stock CFDs and index CFDs.

-

def rerouteMktDepthReq(self, reqId: int, conId: int, exchange: str):

  print("Re-route market depth request. ReqId:", reqId, "ConId:", conId, "Exchange:", exchange)



### Cancel Watchlist DataCopy Location

#### EClient.cancelMktData(

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.
 )

Cancels a watchlist market data request.

-

self.cancelMktData(2001)



### Available Tick TypesCopy Location

EClient.reqMktData will return data to various methods such as EWrapper.tickPrice,  EWrapper.tickSize, EWrapper.tickString, etc. The values returned are  dependent upon the generic tick requested and the type of data returned. The table below references which tick ID will be returned upon  requesting a given generic tick.

*RDD: These tick types are provided only when the user makes a request to [EClient.reqMarketDataType(3)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#delayed-market-data) prior to their market data request.

### HaltedCopy Location

The Halted tick type indicates if a contract has been halted for trading. It can have the following values:

| Value | Description                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -1    | Halted status not available. Usually returned with frozen data. |
| 0     | Not halted. This value will **only** be returned if the contract is in a TWS watchlist. |
| 1     | General halt. Trading halt is imposed for purely regulatory reasons with/without volatility halt. |
| 2     | Volatility halt. Trading halt is imposed by the exchange to protect against extreme volatility. |

### ShortableCopy Location

The shortable tick is an indicative on the amount of shares which can be sold short for the contract:

Receiving the actual number of shares available to short requires TWS 974+. For  detailed information about shortability data (shortable shares, fee  rate) available outside of TWS, IB also provides an FTP site. For more  information on the FTP site, see [knowledge base article 2024](https://www.ibkrguides.com/kb/article-2024.htm)

| Range                 | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Value higher than 2.5 | There are at least 1000 shares available for short selling.  |
| Value higher than 1.5 | This contract will be available for short selling if shares can be located. |
| 1.5 or less           | Contract is not available for short selling.                 |

### Volume DataCopy Location

The API reports the current dayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s volume in several ways. They are summarized as follows:

- Volume tick type 8: The ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œnative volumeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢. This includes delayed transactions,  busted trades, and combos, but will not update with every tick.
- RTVolume: highest number, includes non-reportable trades such as odd lots, average price and derivative trades.
- RTTradeVolume: only includes ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œlastÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ ticks, similar to number also used in charts/historical data.

### RT VolumeCopy Location

The RT Volume tick type corresponds to the TWSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Time & Sales window and contains the last tradeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s price, size and time along with current dayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s total traded volume, Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and whether  or not the trade was filled by a single market maker.

There is a  setting in TWS which displays tick-by-tick data in the TWS Time &  Sales Window. If this setting is checked, it will provide a higher  granularity of data than RTVolume.

Example: 701.28;1;1348075471534;67854;701.46918464;true

As volume for US stocks is reported in lots, a volume of 0 reported in  RTVolume will typically indicate an odd lot data point (less than 100  shares).

It is important to note that while the TWS Time &  Sales Window also has information about trade conditions available with  data points, this data is not available through the API. So for  instance, the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œunreportableÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ trade status displayed with points in the  Time & Sales Window is not available through the API, and that trade data will appear in the API just as any other data point. As always, an API application needs to exercise caution in responding to single data  points.

**Note:** Please be aware that RT Volume is not supported with Cryptocurrencies.

RT Trade Volume

The RT Trade Volume is similar to RT Volume, but designed to avoid relaying back ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unreportable TradesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â shown in TWS Time&Sales via the API. RT  Trade Volume will not contain average price or derivative trades which  are included in RTVolume.

### IB DividendsCopy Location

This tick type provides four different comma-separated elements:

- The sum of dividends for the past 12 months (0.83 in the example below).
- The sum of dividends for the next 12 months (0.92 from the example below).
- The next dividend date (20130219 in the example below).
- The next single dividend amount (0.23 from the example below).

**Example:** 0.83,0.92,20130219,0.23

To receive dividend information it is sometimes necessary to direct-route rather than smart-route market data requests.

### Tick By Tick DataCopy Location

Tick-by-tick data has been available since TWS v969 and API v973.04.

In TWS, tick-by-tick data is available in the Time & Sales Window.

From the API, this corresponds to the function [EClient.reqTickByTickData](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-tick-data). The maximum number of simultaneous tick-by-tick subscriptions allowed  for a user is determined by the same formula used to calculate maximum  number of market depth subscriptions [Limitations](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#live-data-limitations). For some securities, getting tick-by-tick data requires Level 2 data bundles.

- Real time tick-by-tick data is currently not available for options. Historical tick-by-tick data is available.
- The tick type field is case sensitive ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ it must be BidAsk, Last, AllLast,  MidPoint. AllLast has additional trade types such as combos,  derivatives, and average price trades which are not included in Last.
- Tick-by-tick data for options is currently only available historically and not in real time.
- Tick-by-tick data for indices is only provided for indices which are on CME.
- Tick-by-tick data is not available for combos.
- No more than 1 tick-by-tick request can be made for the same instrument within 15 seconds.
- Time & Sales data requires a Level 1, Top Of Book market data subscription. This would be the same subscription as [EClient.reqMktData()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#watchlist-data) or [EClient.reqHistoricalData()](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#historical-bars).

## Market ScannerCopy Location

Some scans in the TWS Advanced Market Scanner can be accessed via the TWS API through the EClient.reqScannerSubscription.

Results are delivered via EWrapper.scannerData and the EWrapper.scannerDataEnd  marker will indicate when all results have been delivered. The returned  results to scannerData simply consist of a list of contracts. There are  no market data fields (bid, ask, last, volume, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦) returned from the  scanner, and so if these are desired they have to be requested  separately with the reqMktData function. Since the scanner results do  not include any market data fields, it is not necessary to have market  data subscriptions to use the API scanner. However to use filters,  market data subscriptions are generally required.

Since the  EClient.reqScannerSubscription request keeps a subscription open you  will keep receiving periodic updates until the request is cancelled via  EClient.cancelScannerSubscription :

Scans are limited to a maximum result of 50 results per scan code, and only 10 API scans can be active at a time.

scannerSubscriptionFilterOptions has been added to the API to allow for generic filters. This field is  entered as a list of TagValues which have a tag followed by its value,  e.g. TagValue(ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“usdMarketCapAboveÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“10000ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â) indicates a market cap above 10000 USD. Available filters can be found using the  EClient.reqScannerParameters function.

A string containing all available XML-formatted parameters will then be returned via EWrapper.scannerParameters.

**Important:** remember the TWS API is just an interface to the TWS. If you are having problems defining a scanner, always make sure you can create a similar scanner  using the TWSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ [Advanced Market Scanner](https://ibkrguides.com/tws/usersguidebook/mosaic/advancedscanner.htm).

## NewsCopy Location

API news requires news subscriptions that are specific to the API; most  news services in TWS are not also available in the API. There are three  API news services enabled in accounts by default and available from the  API. They are:

- Briefing.com General Market Columns (BRFG)
- Briefing.com Analyst Actions (BRFUPDN)
- Dow Jones Newsletters (DJNL)

There are also four additional news services available with all TWS versions which require **API-specific subscriptions** to first be made in Account Management. They have different data fees than the subscription for the same news in TWS-only. As with all  subscriptions, they only apply to the specific TWS username under which  they were made:

- Briefing Trader (BRF)
- Benzinga Pro (BZ)
- Fly on the Wall (FLY)

The API functions which handle news are able to query available news  provides, subscribe to news in real time to receive headlines as they  are released, request specific news articles, and return a historical  list of news stories that are cached in the system.

### News ProvidersCopy Location

Adding or removing API news subscriptions from an account is accomplished  through Account Management. From the API, currently subscribed news  sources can be retrieved using the function  IBApi::EClient::reqNewsProviders. A list of available subscribed news  sources is returned to the function IBApi::EWrapper::newsProviders

### Live News HeadlinesCopy Location

**Important:** in order to obtain news feeds via the TWS API you need to acquire the  relevant API-specific subscriptions via your Account Management.

News articles provided through the API may not correspond to what is  available directly through the Trader Workstation. Off-platform  distribution of data is at the discretion of the news source provider,  not by Interactive Brokers.

When  invoking IBApi.EClient.reqMktData, for a specific IBApi.Contract you  will follow the same format convention as any other basic contracts. The News Source is identified by the genericTickList argument.

**Note:** The error message ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“invalid tick typeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â will be returned if the username has not added the appropriate API news subscription.

***\*Note\**:** For Briefing Trader live head lines via the API is only offered on a  case-by-case basis directly from Briefing.com offers Briefing Trader  subscribers access to the subscription live head lines via the API. For  more information and to submit an API entitlement application, please  contact Briefing.com directly at [dbeasley@briefing.com](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/news.html#).

## Next Valid IDCopy Location

The nextValidId event provides the next valid identifier needed to place an order. It is necessary to use an order ID with new orders which is  greater than all previous order IDs used to place an order. While  requests such as EClient.reqMktData will not increment the minimum  request ID value, more than one market data request cannot use the same  request ID at the same time.

The nextValidId value may be queried  on each request. However, it is often recommended to make a request once at the beginning of the session, and then locally increment the value  for each request.

### Request Next Valid IDCopy Location

#### EClient.reqIds (

**numIds:** int. This parameter will not affect the value returned to nextValidId but is required.
 )

Requests the next valid order ID at the current moment be returned to the EWrapper.nextValidId function.

### Reset Order ID SequenceCopy Location

The next valid identifier is persistent between TWS sessions.

If necessary, you can reset the order ID sequence within the API Settings  dialogue. Note however that the order sequence Id can only be reset if  there are no active API orders.

## Order ManagementCopy Location

### ClientId 0 and the Master Client IDCopy Location

Each TWS API connection maintains its own ClientID to the host through the  EClient.connect function. There are two unique client ID behaviors  developers must be aware of:

- **Master ClientID:** The Master Client ID is set in the Global Configuration and is used to  distinguish the connecting Client ID used to pull order and trades data  even from other API connections. Connecting without using the Master  Client ID will mean only trades on the connected Client ID will be  returning from calls to the openOrder or execDetails functions.
- **ClientID 0:** ClientID 0 is unique from the rest of the client IDs in that users can  receive trades made through Trader Workstation or through FIX in  addition to trades that take place on the current client ID.

The Master ClientID value can be assigned to 0 so that a connection can  retrieve orders placed from TWS, FIX sessions, and all API connections  on the account.

### Commission And Fees ReportCopy Location

When an order is filled either fully or partially, the [IBApi.EWrapper.execDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#exec-details) and IBApi.EWrapper.commissionReport events will deliver [IBApi.Execution](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#exec-details) and IBApi.CommissionAndFeesReport objects. This allows to obtain the full picture of the orderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s execution and the resulting commissions.

- Advisors executing allocation orders  will receive execution details and commissions for the allocation order  itself. To receive allocation details and commissions for a specific  subaccount [IBApi.EClient.reqExecutions](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#request-exec-details) can be used.

#### EWrapper.commissionReport (

**commissionAndFeesReport:** [CommissionAndFeesReport](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#commreport-ref). Returns a commissions report object containing the fields execId,  commission, currency, realizedPnl, yield, and yieldRedemptionDate.
 )

Provides the Commission Report of an Execution

-

def commissionAndFeesReport(self, commissionAndFeesReport: CommissionAndFeesReport):

ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¹    print("CommissionReport.", commissionAndFeesReport)



### Execution DetailsCopy Location

IBApi.Execution and IBApi.CommissionReport can be requested on demand via the  IBApi.EClient.reqExecutions method which receives a  IBApi.ExecutionFilter object as parameter to obtain only those  executions matching the given criteria. An empty IBApi.ExecutionFilter  object can be passed to obtain all previous executions.

Once all matching executions have been delivered, an IBApi.EWrapper.execDetailsEnd event will be triggered.

Important: By default, only those executions occurring since midnight for that  particular account will be delivered. If you want to request executions  from the last 7 days, TWSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Trade Log setting ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Show trades for ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â must  be adjusted to your requirement. The IB Gateway is limited to only  executions from the current trading day since midnight.

### ExecID BehaviorCopy Location

If a correction to an execution is published it will be received as an  additional IBApi.EWrapper.execDetails callback with all parameters  identical except for the execID in the Execution object. The execID will differ only in the digits after the final period.

By default,  most ExecID values will return as 4-segment alphanumeric sequence to  identify each unique order. In the case of Combo orders, you may  encounter a 5-segment alphanumeric sequence which will be used to denote per-leg executions. As an example, if a 1:1 combo for 200 shares of  both contracts is placed, the first leg may fill for 200 shares, then  leg 2 may fill for 100 in one execution, and then another execution for  leg 2 of 100. The fifth segment will distinguish between these unique  inner-combo executions.

### The Execution ObjectCopy Location

The Execution object is used to maintain all data related to a userÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s  traded orders. This can be used in both querying execution details and  navigating received data.

### Understanding Order Status MessageCopy Location

| Status Code   | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PendingSubmit | indicates that you have transmitted the order, but have not yet received  confirmation that it has been accepted by the order destination. |
| PendingCancel | indicates that you have sent a request to cancel the order but have not yet  received cancel confirmation from the order destination. At this point,  your order is not confirmed canceled. It is not guaranteed that the  cancellation will be successful. |
| PreSubmitted  | indicates that a simulated order type has been accepted by the IB system and that this order has yet to be elected. The order is held in the IB system  until the election criteria are met. At that time the order is  transmitted to the order destination as specified. |
| Submitted     | indicates that your order has been accepted by the system.   |
| ApiCancelled  | after an order has been submitted and before it has been acknowledged, an API client client can request its cancelation, producing this state. |
| Cancelled     | indicates that the balance of your order has been confirmed canceled by the IB  system. This could occur unexpectedly when IB or the destination has  rejected your order. |
| Filled        | indicates that the order has been completely filled. Market orders executions will not always trigger a Filled status. |
| Inactive      | indicates that the order was received by the system but is no longer active because it was rejected or canceled. |

### Requesting Currently Active OrdersCopy Location

As long as an order is active, it is possible to retrieve it using the TWS API. Orders submitted via the TWS API will always be bound to the  client application (i.e. client Id) they were submitted from meaning  only the submitting client will be able to modify the placed order.  Three different methods are provided to allow for maximum flexibility.  Active orders will be returned via the [IBApi.EWrapper.openOrder](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#open-orders) and [IBApi.EWrapper.orderStatus](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#order-status) methods as already described in [The openOrder callback](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#open-orders) and [The orderStatus callback](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#order-status) sections

**Note:** it is not possible to obtain cancelled or fully filled orders.

### API client's ordersCopy Location

The IBApi.EClient.reqOpenOrders method allows to obtain all active orders  submitted by the client application connected with the exact same client Id with which the order was sent to the TWS. If client 0 invokes  reqOpenOrders, it will cause currently open orders placed from TWS  manually to be ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œboundÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, i.e. assigned an order ID so that they can be  modified or cancelled by the API client 0.

When an order is bound  by API client 0 there will be callback to IBApi::EWrapper::orderBound.  This indicates the mapping between API order ID and permID. The [IBApi.EWrapper.orderBound](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#order-bound-notification) callback in response to newly bound orders that indicates the mapping  between the permID (unique account-wide) and API Order ID (specific to  an API client). In the API settings in Global Configuration, is a  setting checked by default ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Use negative numbers to bind automatic  ordersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â which will specify how manual TWS orders are assigned an API  order ID.

## OrdersCopy Location

### The Order ObjectCopy Location

The order object is an essential piece of the TWS API which is used to both place and manage orders. This is primarily built with an ever  increasing range of attributes used to create the best order possible.  With that being said, the value to the right represents the required  fields in order to place or reference any order. Keep in mind that there are several other attributes that can and should be referenced.

#### Order()

**action:** String. Determines whether the contract should be a BUY or SELL.

**auxPrice:** double. Used to determine the stop price for STP, STP LMT, and TRAIL orders.

**lmtPrice:** double. Used to determine the limit price for LMT, STP LMT, and TRAIL orders.

**orderType:** String. Specify the type of order to place. For example, MKT, LMT, STP.

**tif:** String. Time in force for the order. Default tif is DAY.

**totalQuantity:** decimal. Total size of the order.

Given additional structures for orders are ever evolving, it is recommended  to review the relevant order class in your programming language for a  comprehensive review of what fields are available.

 [Order Class Reference](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#order-ref)

### Cancelling an OrderCopy Location

An order can be cancelled from the API with the functions EClient.cancelOrder and EClient::reqGlobalCancel.

EClient.cancelOrder can only be used to cancel an order that was placed originally by a  client with the same client ID (or from TWS for client ID 0).

EClient.reqGlobalCancel will cancel all open orders, regardless of how they were originally placed.

### Cancel Individual OrderCopy Location

#### EClient.cancelOrder (

**orderId:** int. Specify which order should be cancelled by its identifier.

**orderCancel:** orderCancel. An OrderCancel object that can receive the  manualOrderCancelTime, manualOrderIndicator, and extOperator fields. See [OrderCancel Reference](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#ordercancel-ref) for more insight on the OrderCancel class.
 )

Cancels an active order placed by from the same API client ID.

**Note:** API clients cannot cancel individual orders placed by other clients. Only reqGlobalCancel is available.

### Exercise OptionsCopy Location

Options are exercised or lapsed from the API with the function EClient.exerciseOptions.

- Option exercise will appear with order status side = ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“BUYÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and limit price of 0, but only at the time the request is made
- Option exercise can be distinguished by price = 0

**tickerId:** int. Exercise requestÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s identifier

**contract:** Contract. the option Contract to be exercised.

**exerciseAction:** int. Set to 1 to exercise the option, set to 2 to let the option lapse.

**exerciseQuantity:** int. Number of contracts to be exercised

**account:** String. Destination account

**ovrd:** int. Specifies whether your setting will override the systemÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s natural action.
 Set to 1 to override, set to 0 not to.

For example, if your action is ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“exerciseÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and the option is not  in-the-money, by natural action the option would not exercise. If you  have override set to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“yesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â the natural action would be overridden and  the out-of-the money option would be exercised.

**manualOrderTime:** String. Specify the time at which the options should be exercised. An empty string will assume the current time.
 Required TWS API 10.26 or higher.
 )

Exercises an options contract.

**Note:** this function is affected by a TWS setting which specifies if an exercise request must be finalized.

self.exerciseOptions(5003, contract, 1, 1, self.account, 1, "")



### Minimum Price IncrementCopy Location

The minimum increment is the minimum difference between price levels at  which a contract can trade. Some trades have constant price increments  at all price levels. However some contracts have difference minimum  increments on different exchanges on which they trade and/or different  minimum increments at different price levels. In the contractDetails  class, there is a field ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œminTickÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ which specifies the smallest possible  minimum increment encountered on any exchange or price. For complete  information about minimum price increment structure, there is the IB  Contracts and Securities search site, or the API function  EClient.reqMarketRule.

The function [EClient.reqContractDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-contract-details) when used with a Contract object will return contractDetails object to  the contractDetails function which has a list of the valid exchanges  where the instrument trades. Also within the contractDetails object is a field called marketRuleIDs which has a list of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“market rulesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â. A market rule is defined as a rule which defines the minimum price increment  given the price. The market rule list returned in contractDetails has a  list of market rules in the same order as the list of valid exchanges.  In this way, the market rule ID for a contract on a particular exchange  can be determined.

- Market rule for forex and forex CFDs indicates default configuration (1/2 and  not 1/10 pips). It can be adjusted to 1/10 pips through TWS or IB  Gateway Global Configuration.
- Some non-US securities, for  instance on the SEHK exchange, have a minimum lot size. This information is not available from the API but can be obtained from the IB Contracts and Securities search page. It will also be indicated in the error  message returned from an order which does not conform to the minimum lot size.

With the market rule ID number, the corresponding  rule can be found with the API function EClient.reqMarketRule. The rule  is returned to the function EWrapper.marketRule.

- For forex,  there is an option in TWS/IB Gateway configuration which allows trading  in 1/10 pips instead of 1/5 pips (the default).
- TWS Global Configuration -> Display -> Ticker Row -> Allow Forex trading in 1/10 pips

### Request Market RuleCopy Location

#### EClient.reqMarketRule (

**marketRuleId**: int. The id of market rule
 )

New TWS and IB Gateway Order Presets can be found in the Orders > MiFIR  page of Global Configuration, and include TWS Decision-Maker Defaults,  API Decision-Maker Defaults, and Executing Trader/Algo presets.

The following choices are available for the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“investment decision within the  firmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionMaker and IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionAlgo attributes:

1. This field does not need to be reported if you are:

   - Using the TWS API to transmit orders, AND
   - The investment decision is always made by the client, AND
   - None of these clients are an EEA investment firm with delegated reporting selected (the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“delegated reporting firmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â).

   You can configure the preset to indicate this via TWS Global Configuration  using the Orders > MiFIR page. In this scenario, the orders for the  proprietary account will need to be placed via TWS.

2. If you  are using the TWS API to transmit orders, and the investment decision is made by a person, or a group of people within a delegated reporting  firm, with one person being the primary decision maker:

   - Your TWS  API program can, on each order, transmit a decision makerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s IB-assigned  short code using the field IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionMaker. You can  define persons who can be the decision-makers via IB Account Management. To obtain the short codes that IB assigned to those persons, please  contact IB Client Services.
   - If your TWS API program is unable to transmit the above field, and the investment decision is either made  by, or approved by, a single person who can be deemed to be the primary  investment decision maker, you can pre-configure a default investment  decision-maker that will be used for orders where the above fields are  not present. You must define the investment decision-maker(s) in IB  Account Management, and can then configure the default investment  decision-maker in TWS Global Configuration using the Orders > MiFIR  page.

3. If you are using the TWS API to transmit orders and the investment decision is made by an algorithm:

   - Your TWS API program can, on each order, transmit a decision makerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s  IB-assigned short code using the field IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionAlgo.  You can define algorithms that can be the decision-makers via IB Account Management. To obtain the short codes that IB assigned to those  persons, please contact IB Client Services.

   - If your TWS API  program is unable to transmit the above field, and/or the investment  decision is made by a single or primary decision-maker algorithm, you  can pre-configure a default investment decision-maker algo that will be  used for orders where the above field is not sent. You must define the  investment decision-maker(s) in IB Account Management, and can then  configure the default investment decision-maker in TWS Global  Configuration using the Orders > MiFIR page.

     *NOTE: Only ONE  investment decision-maker, either a primary person or algorithm, should  be provided on an order, or selected as the default.*

1. No additional information is needed if you are using the TWS API to  transmit orders entered in a third-party trading interface, and you are  the trader responsible for execution within the firm.
2. If your TWS API program transmits orders to IB automatically without human intervention, please contact **IB Client Services** to register the program or programs with IB as an algo. Only the primary  program or algo needs to be registered and identified. You can then  configure the default in TWS Global Configuration using the Orders >  MiFIR page.
3. Your TWS API program, on each order, can transmit  the IB-assigned short code of the algo or person responsible for  execution within the firm using the  field IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionAlgo (for the algorithm)  or IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionTrader (for the person).

For  more information, or to obtain short codes for persons or algos defined  in IB Account Management, please contact IB Client Services.

### Modifying OrdersCopy Location

Modification of an API order can be done if the API client is connected to a session of TWS with the same username of TWS and using the same API client ID.  The function [EClient.placeOrder](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#place-order) can then be called with the same fields as the open order, except for  the parameter to modify. This includes the Order.OrderId, which must  match the Order.OrderId of the **open** order. It is not generally  recommended to try to change order fields aside from order price, size,  and tif (for DAY -> IOC modifications). To change other parameters,  it might be preferable to instead cancel the open order, and create a  new one.

- To modify or cancel an individual order placed manually from TWS, it is  necessary to connect with client ID 0 and then bind the order before  attempting to modify it. The process of binding assigns the order an API order ID; prior to binding it will be returned to the API with an **API order ID of 0**. Orders with API order ID 0 cannot be modified/cancelled from the API.  The function reqOpenOrders binds orders open at that moment which do not already have an API order ID, and the function reqAutoOpenOrders binds  future orders automatically. The function reqAllOpenOrders does not bind orders.
- To modify API orders when connecting to a different  session of TWS (logged in with a different username than used for the  original order), it is necessary to first bind the order with client ID 0 in the same manner as manual TWS orders are bound before they can be  modified. The binding assignment of API order IDs is independent for  each TWS user, so the same order can have different API order IDs for  different users. The permID returned in the API Order class which is  assigned by TWS can be used to identify an order in an account uniquely.
- The process of order binding from the API cancels/resubmits an order  working on an exchange. This may affect the orderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s place in the  exchange queue. Enhancements are planned to allow for API binding with  modification of exchange queue priority.

### Place OrderCopy Location

Orders are submitted via the EClient.placeOrder method.

Immediately after an order is submitted correctly, the TWS will start sending events concerning the orderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s activity via [EWrapper.openOrder](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#open-order) and [EWrapper.orderStatus](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#order-status)

Advisors executing allocation orders will receive execution details and  commissions for the allocation order itself. To receive allocation  details and commissions for a specific subaccount [EClient.reqExecutions](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#request-exec-details) can be used.

An order can be sent to TWS but not transmitted to the IB server by  setting the Order.Transmit flag in the order class to False.  Untransmitted orders will only be available within that TWS session (not for other usernames) and will be cleared on restart. Also, they can be  cancelled or transmitted from the API but not viewed while they remain  in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“untransmittedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â state.

#### EClient.placeOrder (

**id:** int. The orderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s unique identifier. If a new order is placed with an  order ID less than or equal to the order ID of a previous order an error will occur.

**contract:** Contract. The orderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s contract

**order:** Order. The order object.

### Understanding Order PrecautionsCopy Location

By default, the Trader Workstation implements several precautionary  settings that will notify customers of potential order risks to make  sure users are well informed before transmitting orders. As a result,  customers will typically need to acknowledge a precautionary message and manually transmit the orders through the Trader Workstation. These  precautionary messages may be disabled if the user is comfortable and  aware of the behavior they are disabling.


### Disabling Warning Messages

1. Log in to the Trader Workstation
2. Open the Global Configuration by selecting the Cog Wheel icon in the top right corner
3. Navigate to the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“MessagesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â section on the left.
4. **Carefully read each message before disabling it**. You can then disable the warning by unchecking the box on the right of the message description.

### Modifying Precautionary Settings

1. Log in to the Trader Workstation
2. Open the Global Configuration by selecting the Cog Wheel icon in the top right corner
3. Navigate to the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“PresetsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â section on the left
4. Select the instrument(s) you are trading
5. **Carefully read each setting before making changes to it.** You may modify the values inside the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Precautionary SettingsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â settings to  be more or less restrictive. You may also set the value to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œ0ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ to  disable the precaution entirely.

### Order Placement ConsiderationsCopy Location

When placing orders via the API and building a robust trading system, it is  important to monitor for callback notifications, specifically for **[IBApi::EWrapper::error](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#error)**, [**IBApi:**:**EWrapper::orderStatus** ](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#order-status)changes, [**IBApi::EWrapper::openOrder** ](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#open-orders)warnings, and **[IBApi::EWrapper::execDetails](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#receive-exec-details)** to ensure proper operation.

If you experience issues with orders you place via the API, such as orders not filling, the first thing to check is what these callbacks returned. Your order may have been rejected or cancelled. If needed, see the **[API Log ](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#log-location)**section, for information on obtaining your API logs or submitting them for review.

Common cases of order rejections, cancellations, and warnings, and the corresponding message returned:

- If an order is subject to a large size (LGSZ) reject, the API client would receive

  Error (201)

   via

  [IBApi::EWrapper::error](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#error)

  . The error text would indicate that order size too large and suggest another smaller size.

  - In accordance with our regulatory obligations as a broker, we cannot  accept Large Limit Orders for #### shares of ABCD that you have  submitted. Please submit a smaller order (not exceeding ###) *or convert your order to an algorithmic Order (IBALGO) [conditional on instrument]*

- If an order is subject to price checks the client may receive status (cancelled) +

  Error (202)

   via

  **IBApi.EWrapper.orderStatus**

   and

  [IBApi::EWrapper::error](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#error)

  . The error text would indicate the price is too far from current price.

  - In accordance with our regulatory obligations as a broker, we cannot  accept your order at the limit price ### you selected because it is too  far through the market. Please submit your order using a limit price  that is closer to the current market price ###

- The client may receive warning Text via

  [IBApi::EWrapper::openOrder](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#open-orders)

   indicating that the order could be subject to price capping.

  - If your order does not immediately execute, in accordance with our  regulatory obligations as a broker we may, depending on market  conditions, reject your order if the limit price of your order is more  than allowed distance from the current reference price. This is designed to ensure that the price of your order is in line with an orderly  market and reduce the impact your order has on the market. Please note  that such rejection will result in you not receiving a fill.
  - ***[mktCapPrice](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#order-status)\*** ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ If an order has been capped, this indicates the current capped price (returned to[ **IBApi.EWrapper.orderStatus**](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#open-orders))

### Pre-Borrow Shares For ShortingCopy Location

The TWS API supports the ability to pre-borrow shares for shorting.

- See [here](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/About Pre-Borrows) for Pre-Borrow Eligibility
- See [here](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/pricing/other-fees.php#:~:text=Stock Loan-,Pre-Borrows,-Universal) for pricing details

To place a Pre-Borrow order, users must:

- Assign the contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s exchange to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“PREBORROWÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â
- Assign the contractÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s security type to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“SBLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â
-  Assign the orderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s orderType to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“MKTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â

-

contract = Contract()

contract.symbol = symbol

contract.secType = "SBL"

contract.exchange = "PREBORROW"

contract.currency = "USD"

order = Order()

order.action = "BUY"

order.orderType = "MKT"

order.totalQuantity = quantity



### Test Order Impact (WhatIf)Copy Location

From the API it is possible to check how a specified trade execution is  expected to change the account margin requirements for an account in  real time. This is done by creating an Order object which has the  IBApi.Order.WhatIf flag set to true. By default, the whatif boolean in  Order has a false value, but if set to True in an Order object with is  passed to [IBApi.EClient.placeOrder](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#place-order), instead of sending the order to a destination the IB server it will  undergo a credit check for the expected post-trade margin requirement.  The estimated post-trade margin requirement is returned to  the IBApi.OrderState object in the [EWrapper.openOrder](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#open-orders) callback..

This is equivalent to creating a order ticket in TWS, clicking ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“PreviewÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â,  and viewing the information in the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Margin ImpactÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â panel.



For example, most users want to check the margin details or available  leverage of the order. Here is the example of checking the Initial  Maintenance Margin Change.

Python:

def openOrder(self, orderId: OrderId, contract: Contract, order: Order, orderState: OrderState):

ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¹    print(orderId, contract, order, orderState.initMarginChange)

.

.

.

order.whatIf = True

.

.

.

self.placeOrder(order_id, contract, order)

Expected output:

210 152791428,700,STK,,0,?,,SEHK,,HKD,700,700,False,,,,combo: 210,1,1832692965: MKT BUY 100@0 DAY 12567.5

You can see that 12567.5 is the initMarginChange which matches the Initial  Margin Change result shown in TWS Order Ticket Preview.

![Initial margin change in the Order preview window.](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)





Apart from InitMarginChange, there are other supported variables. For details, please visit: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#orderstate-ref



### Trigger MethodsCopy Location

The Trigger Method defined in the [IBApi.Order](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/trader-workstation-api/#order-object) class specifies how simulated stop, stop-limit, and trailling stops, and conditional orders are triggered. Valid values are:

- 0 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ The default method for instrument
- 1 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Double bid/askÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â function, where stop orders are triggered based on two consecutive bid or ask prices.
- 2 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“LastÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â function, where stop orders are triggered based on the last price
- 3 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Double lastÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â function
- 4 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Bid/ask function
- 7 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Last or bid/ask function
- 8 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Mid-point function

**Important notes** :

- If an incompatible triggerMethod and secType are used in your API order, the order may never trigger.
- These trigger methods only apply to stop orders simulated by IB. If a  stop-variant is handled natively, the trigger method specified is  ignored. See our [Stop Orders](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=609) page for more information.

## TWS UI Display GroupsCopy Location

Display Groups function allows API clients to integrate with [TWS Color Grouping Windows](https://www.ibkrguides.com/tws/usersguidebook/specializedorderentry/use_windows_grouping_to_link_blotter.htm).

TWS Color Grouping Windows are identified by a colored chain in TWS and by  an integer number via the API. Currently that number ranges from 1 to 7  and are mapped to specific colors, as indicated in TWS.

### Query Display GroupsCopy Location

The IBApi.EClient.queryDisplayGroups method is used to request all  available Display Groups in TWS. The IBApi.EWrapper.displayGroupList is a one-time response to IBApi.EClient.queryDisplayGroups.

It returns a list of integers representing visible Group ID separated by the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“|ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  character, and sorted by most used group first. This list will not  change during TWS session. In other words, user cannot add a new group,  but only the sorting of the group numbers can change.

Example: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“4|1|2|5|3|6|7ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â

### Event DataCopy Location

The function EClient.reqWshEventData is used to request various calendar  events from Wall Street Horizon. The event data is then received via the callback EWrapper.wshEventData. Pending event data requests can be  canceled with the function IBApi.EClient.cancelWshEventData.

**Note:** Prior to sending this message, the API client must make a request for metadata via [EClient.reqWshMetaData](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#meta-data).

Also note that TWS will not support multiple concurrent requests. Previous  request should succeed, fail, or be cancelled by client before next one. TWS will reject such requests with text ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Duplicate WSH meta-data  requestÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Duplicate WSH event requestÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â.

### WshEventData ObjectCopy Location

When making a request to the Wall Street Horizons Event Calendar with the  API, users must create a wshEventData Object. This object contains  several fields, along with a filter field, which takes a json-formatted  string. The filter values are returned from WSH Meta Data requests.

When creating the object, users are able to specify either the  WshEventData.conId, WshEventData.startDate, and WshEventData.endDate, or they may choose to use the WshEventData.filter value. Attempting to use both will result in an error.

Only one Event Type tag may be passed per request. Multiple submitted filters will be ignored beyond the final request.
