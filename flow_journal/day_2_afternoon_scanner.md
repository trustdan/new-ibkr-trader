## 🏗️ What We're Building

High-performance options scanner in Go that:
1. Receives scan requests from Python service
2. Processes large volumes of options data concurrently
3. Applies complex filters efficiently
4. Returns results via REST API
5. Maintains its own cache for performance

## 📝 Session Notes

Starting with Go scanner foundation. The vibe is to create something that feels fast and responsive, complementing our async Python service perfectly.

## 🌊 Vibe Maintenance
- Go's concurrency fits our async vibe perfectly
- Keep the scanner modular and extensible
- Performance matters but clarity matters more
- Celebrate the speed gains!

## ✅ Accomplishments

1. ✅ Created complete Go module structure with clean architecture:
   - cmd/scanner for entry point
   - internal packages for business logic
   - pkg/models for shared types
2. ✅ Implemented high-performance scanner service:
   - Concurrent filtering with goroutines
   - In-memory caching with go-cache
   - Clean separation of concerns
3. ✅ Built REST API with Gin framework:
   - Health check endpoint
   - Scan endpoint with validation
   - Statistics endpoint
   - Prometheus metrics integration
4. ✅ Created flexible filter system:
   - Filter interface for extensibility
   - Filter chain pattern
   - Implemented delta, DTE, volume, OI, IV percentile filters
   - Easy to add new filters
5. ✅ Set up communication with Python service:
   - HTTP client for fetching options data
   - Proper context handling
   - Error propagation
6. ✅ Added comprehensive monitoring:
   - Prometheus metrics for all operations
   - Request logging with zap
   - Performance tracking

## 🌊 Flow State Achieved
The Go scanner complements our async Python service perfectly! The concurrent filtering will handle high-volume scans with ease.
