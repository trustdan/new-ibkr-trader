# Day 2 Morning: Core Infrastructure

**Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Start Time**: 7:45 PM  
**Energy Level**: 9/10  
**Vibe**: Ready to build! The foundation is solid, time to create the async-first infrastructure.

## 🎯 Session Goals (from MASTER_PLAN_UNIFIED.md)

- [ ] Python container with ib-insync environment
- [ ] Basic TWS connection testing framework
- [ ] Initial logging infrastructure

## 📋 Pre-Session Checklist
- [ ] Review Day 1 completion summary
- [ ] Check async pattern templates are ready
- [ ] Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- [ ] Have ib-insync documentation handy
- [ ] Clear mental space for deep work

## 🏗️ What We're Building

Setting up the core infrastructure that all other components will rely on:
1. Docker environment for isolated, reproducible development
2. Python service foundation with proper async structure
3. Connection layer to TWS with retry logic
4. Logging that maintains flow (not too verbose, not too quiet)

## 📝 Session Notes

[Document your journey here - challenges, solutions, insights]

## 🌊 Vibe Maintenance
- Remember: Infrastructure is the foundation of flow
- Keep it simple, make it work, then make it elegant
- If energy dips, take a break and review the manifesto
- Celebrate small wins (first successful TWS connection!)

## ✅ Accomplishments

1. ✅ Created complete Docker directory structure
2. ✅ Built async-first Python IBKR Dockerfile with:
   - uvloop for high-performance async
   - ib-insync 0.9.86 for TWS integration
   - Prometheus metrics built-in
   - Health checks that don't block event loop
3. ✅ Created comprehensive docker-compose.yml with:
   - Proper host networking for TWS connection
   - Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
   - Service dependencies and health checks
4. ✅ Implemented core Python service structure:
   - AsyncIBKRService with event-driven patterns
   - Watchdog for auto-reconnection
   - Complete event handler setup
5. ✅ Built vibe-aware logging system:
   - Emoji-enhanced development logs
   - JSON structured logs for production
   - Async-safe configuration
6. ✅ Created monitoring infrastructure:
   - Prometheus metrics for all operations
   - Connection status tracking
   - API performance monitoring
   - Vibe level gauge (starting at 9/10!)
7. ✅ Implemented REST API with aiohttp:
   - Health check endpoint
   - Connection test endpoint
   - Account summary endpoint
   - Metrics endpoint for Prometheus

## 🌊 Flow State Achieved
The async patterns flowed naturally! The infrastructure is ready for TWS connection testing.

## 🔮 Next Session Preview

Afternoon: Go Scanner Foundation
