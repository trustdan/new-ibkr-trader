## Completed Experiments

### Experiment: Vibe-Driven Project Foundation
Date: 2025-01-06
Question: What if we establish the entire project foundation based on flow states and developer vibes?

#### Hypothesis
Creating a project structure that prioritizes developer flow and intuitive organization will lead to more sustainable and enjoyable development.

#### Implementation
- Created `.vibe/` directory for project philosophy
- Established flow journal system for progress tracking
- Built comprehensive async templates before writing code
- Organized directories by intuitive function rather than technical convention

#### Results
- Foundation phase completed with high energy levels (8-9/10)
- Clear mental model established before any code written
- Templates ready for immediate use in implementation
- Developer satisfaction significantly higher than traditional approaches

#### Learnings
- Documentation-first approach in a vibe context actually increases momentum
- Flow journals provide both progress tracking and energy management
- Async pattern templates are essential for maintaining flow with ib-insync
- The `.vibe/` directory concept creates a unique project identity

#### Next Steps
- Apply vibe principles to Docker container setup (Day 2)
- Use established templates for actual ib-insync implementation
- Monitor if vibe approach scales with code complexity
