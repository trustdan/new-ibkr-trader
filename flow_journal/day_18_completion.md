  - Delta positioning and directional risk
  - Gamma risk evaluation
  - Theta capture optimization
  - Vega exposure management
  - Rho sensitivity tracking
- Overall risk scoring (0-100)
- Actionable recommendations
- Spread comparison and ranking

### 3. Performance Benchmarking âœ…
- Complete benchmark test suite
- Tests for:
  - Filter chain performance

  - Scan metrics (by symbol, spreads found)
  - Filter metrics (pass rates, duration)
  - Scoring metrics (distribution, duration)
  - Greeks metrics (risk scores)
  - Cache metrics (hits, misses, size)
  - System metrics (goroutines, memory, CPU)
  - Backpressure metrics
  - Circuit breaker state

## Code Statistics
