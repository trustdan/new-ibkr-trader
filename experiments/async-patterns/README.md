# ðŸ§ª Async Patterns Experiments

This directory is our playground for testing ib-insync patterns before integrating them into production code. Feel free to break things here!

## Purpose
- Test async/await patterns with ib-insync
- Experiment with event handling approaches
- Try different connection strategies
- Benchmark performance ideas
- Explore edge cases safely

## Structure
```
async-patterns/
â”œâ”€â”€ connection_tests/     # Different ways to connect
â”œâ”€â”€ event_experiments/    # Event handler patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ rate_limit_tests/     # Testing API limits
â”œâ”€â”€ market_data_tests/    # Subscription experiments
â””â”€â”€ order_tests/          # Order execution trials
```

## Guidelines
1. **Break things freely** - This is the safe space
2. **Document discoveries** - Add notes about what worked/didn't
3. **Keep it messy** - Perfect code isn't the goal here
4. **Share insights** - Update flow journal with learnings

## Quick Test Template

if __name__ == '__main__':
    util.run(experiment())
```

## Current Experiments
- [ ] Test watchdog reconnection patterns
- [ ] Measure event handler performance
- [ ] Try different subscription strategies
- [ ] Explore order preview workflows

Remember: If it works here, refactor it for production. If it doesn't, learn why!
