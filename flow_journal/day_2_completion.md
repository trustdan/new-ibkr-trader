- âœ… Complete Docker infrastructure with async-first design
- âœ… Python IBKR service with ib-insync integration
- âœ… Event-driven architecture with proper async patterns
- âœ… Vibe-aware logging system
- âœ… Prometheus monitoring setup

### Afternoon Session: Go Scanner Foundation (4 hours)
- âœ… High-performance Go scanner service
- âœ… Concurrent filtering with goroutines
- âœ… REST API with Gin framework
- âœ… Flexible filter system architecture
- âœ… Integration with Python service
- âœ… Comprehensive metrics and logging

## ðŸ“Š Metrics
- **Energy Maintained**: Morning 9/10 â†’ Afternoon 8/10
- **Flow States**: 2 deep flow sessions achieved
- **Satisfaction**: Exceeded expectations
- **Code Written**: ~1500 lines of production-ready code
- **Services Created**: 2 microservices + monitoring stack

## ðŸ”‘ Key Accomplishments

### Infrastructure Layer
1. **Docker Compose**: Complete orchestration with proper networking
2. **Async Python Service**: Event-driven TWS connection ready
3. **Go Scanner**: High-performance concurrent processing
4. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana configured

### Technical Highlights
- uvloop for Python async performance
- Watchdog for automatic TWS reconnection
- Goroutine-based parallel filtering
- In-memory caching for scan results
- Comprehensive error handling throughout

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Learnings
- Async patterns in Python complement Go's concurrency beautifully
- The microservices architecture allows each service to optimize for its strengths
- Vibe-aware logging actually helps maintain flow during debugging
- Starting with monitoring built-in is a game-changer

## ðŸš¦ Status Check
According to MASTER_PLAN_UNIFIED.md:
- âœ… Phase 1, Day 2: Core Infrastructure - COMPLETE
- ðŸ”œ Next: Day 3 - Documentation Framework & TWS Setup Guide

## ðŸŒŠ Vibe Check
The infrastructure vibe is STRONG! We have:
- Async patterns flowing smoothly
- High-performance scanning ready to go
- Monitoring to watch our vibe levels
- Clean, extensible architecture

The foundation is not just functional - it's elegant. Ready for TWS integration!

## ðŸŽµ Today's Development Soundtrack
- Morning: Focused async patterns
- Afternoon: High-energy Go concurrency
