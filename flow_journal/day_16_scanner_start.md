# Flow Journal - Day 16 - Scanner Engine Start

## 🌅 Morning Intention
- Date: 2025-01-15
- Energy level: 9/10 (Fresh start on new phase!)
- Focus area: Phase 2 - Go Scanner Engine Foundation
- Vibe: Building the high-performance heart of our system
- Platform: Linux (WSL) - Perfect for Go development

## 🎯 Session Goals
1. Set up Go development environment
2. Create scanner container structure
3. Define core scanner interfaces
4. Build basic filter framework
5. Set up integration with Python container

## 🏗️ Architecture Vision
```
Python Container (Phase 1) 
       ↓ Market Data
Go Scanner Engine (Phase 2)
       ↓ Filtered Results
GUI Application (Phase 3)
```

## 💭 Morning Approach
- Start with clean Go project structure
- Focus on performance from day one
- Build with concurrency in mind
- Create clear API boundaries

## 🚀 Let's Build!
Time to create the high-performance scanner that will process thousands of option contracts in milliseconds!

## 📊 Day 16 Progress - Scanner Foundation Complete!

### ✅ Completed:
1. **Go Development Environment** - Module initialized with dependencies
2. **Scanner Directory Structure** - Clean architecture with internal packages
3. **Core Models** - OptionContract, VerticalSpread, ScanResult
4. **Filter System** - Modular filter architecture with:
   - Delta filter (with absolute value support)
   - DTE (Days to Expiration) filter
   - Liquidity filter (volume, OI, bid-ask spread)
   - Advanced filters (Theta, Vega, IV, IV Percentile)
   - Spread-specific filters (width, probability of profit)
5. **Scanner Service** - Core scanning logic with:
   - Concurrent scanning support
   - Caching layer (5-minute TTL)
   - Vertical spread generation
   - Scoring algorithm
6. **API Layer** - RESTful API with WebSocket support:
   - Single/multiple symbol scanning
   - Filter management
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
7. **Tests** - Comprehensive unit tests (all passing!)
8. **Docker Support** - Multi-stage Dockerfile ready

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights:
- **Clean separation**: Models, filters, service, API layers
- **Concurrency built-in**: Worker pool pattern for multiple symbols
- **Caching**: Reduces API calls to Python service
- **Extensible filters**: Easy to add new filter types
- **Real-time capable**: WebSocket for streaming results

### 📈 Performance Features:
- Concurrent scanning with configurable workers
- Efficient memory usage with pre-allocated slices
- Caching to reduce redundant API calls
- Optimized filter chain processing

### 🔄 Next Steps (Day 17):
1. Implement actual Python API integration
2. Add more sophisticated scoring algorithms
3. Implement filter persistence
4. Add metrics and monitoring
5. Performance benchmarking
