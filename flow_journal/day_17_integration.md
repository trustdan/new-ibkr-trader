# Day 17: Python-Go Integration

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Phase**: 2 - Go Scanner Engine  
**Focus**: Connecting Python IBKR service with Go Scanner  

## Morning State

**Previous Achievement**: Go Scanner Foundation Complete! 
- Clean architecture with models, filters, service, API layers
- Comprehensive filter system (delta, DTE, liquidity, advanced)
- Concurrent scanning with caching
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- All unit tests passing

**Today's Mission**: Bridge the gap between our Python IBKR connection layer and Go scanner engine.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Python API Client** 
   - HTTP client for calling Go scanner API
   - Request/response models
   - Error handling and retries

2. **Request Coordination**
   - Route market data requests through Python to Go
   - Handle concurrent scan requests
   - Maintain request context

3. **Backpressure Handling**
   - Rate limiting coordination
   - Queue management
   - Graceful degradation

### Integration Points

```
Python IBKR Service          Go Scanner Service
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│ Market Data     │ ──────> │ Scanner API     │
│ Connection      │         │ /scan endpoint  │
│                 │ <────── │                 │
│ Order Execution │         │ WebSocket       │
└─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
```

## Technical Approach

### 1. Python Scanner Client
- Use `httpx` for async HTTP
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add connection pooling

### 2. Data Flow
- Python fetches option chains from IBKR
- Sends to Go scanner for filtering/scoring
- Receives ranked spreads back
- Executes trades through Python

### 3. Error Handling
- Network failures between services
- Scanner service unavailable
- Data consistency issues
- Request timeout handling

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `scanner_client.py` in Python service
2. Add request/response models
3. Implement async HTTP client
4. Add retry and circuit breaker patterns
5. Create integration endpoints
6. Write comprehensive tests

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Python can successfully call Go scanner
- [ ] Proper error handling across service boundary
- [ ] Request coordination working
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance baseline established

## Vibe Check
- Energy: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 (High - bridging services!)
- Focus: Integration Excellence
- Momentum: Building on solid foundations

## Notes
- Keep services loosely coupled
- Use clear contracts between services
- Monitor cross-service latency
- Plan for service discovery later
