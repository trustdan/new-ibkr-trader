# Day 3 Afternoon Flow Journal - Architecture & ADRs
## Date: 2025-01-13 Afternoon Session

### ðŸŽ¯ Session Goals
Document the event-driven architecture and establish ADR (Architecture Decision Record) practice for the project.

### ðŸŒŠ Flow State Entry
- Energy: Sustained - Ready for architectural thinking
- Focus: System design and decision documentation
- Intention: Create clear architectural guidance for future development

### ðŸ“‹ Key Tasks
1. âœ… Create event-driven architecture documentation
2. âœ… Write subscription limits guide by TWS tier
3. âœ… Document order ID management patterns
4. âœ… Create first ADR (async-first design)
5. âœ… Set up monitoring metrics documentation
6. âœ… Create developer quickstart guide

### ðŸŽµ Flow Rhythm
- Approach: Architectural clarity with practical examples
- Method: Document decisions with rationale
- Pace: Thoughtful - architecture sets the foundation

### ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- Event-driven architecture naturally fits TWS's callback model
- ADRs capture the "why" behind our architectural choices
- Clear subscription management prevents costly overages
- Order ID management is critical for production safety

### ðŸ”„ Progress Notes
- Creating architecture docs in `/documentation/architecture/`
- Establishing ADR template and first records
- Building from morning's TWS documentation

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
After afternoon session:
- Day 4: Scanner documentation and strategy examples
- Continue building on architectural foundation
- Prepare for implementation phase

### ðŸŒŸ Vibe Check
- Maintaining architectural coherence
- Every decision documented with context
- Building for future maintainability
