# Windows Development Handoff

## Overview

This document describes what has been completed on Linux and what needs to be done on Windows for Phase 1 (IBKR Connection Layer).

## Completed on Linux ‚úÖ

### Architecture & Design
- Comprehensive architecture document: `docs/architecture/python-connection-layer.md`
- Component design with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture leveraging ib-insync

### Core Implementation
1. **Connection Manager** (`src/python/ibkr_connector/connection.py`)
   - Connection lifecycle management
   - State tracking
   - Event emission
   - Error handling framework

2. **Event System** (`src/python/ibkr_connector/events.py`)
   - Pub-sub event manager
   - Support for sync/async handlers
   - Event history tracking
   - Standard event constants

3. **Rate Limiter** (`src/python/ibkr_connector/rate_limiter.py`)
   - Token bucket algorithm
   - 45 req/sec safety limit
   - Request queuing
   - Performance statistics

4. **Configuration** (`src/python/config/settings.py`)
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Validation
   - Sensible defaults

5. **Exceptions** (`src/python/ibkr_connector/exceptions.py`)
   - Custom exception hierarchy
   - TWS error code mapping

### Unit Tests
- Connection manager tests with mocks
- Event system tests
- Rate limiter tests
- pytest configuration

## Required on Windows üñ•Ô∏è

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Install TWS (latest stable version)
- [ ] Configure TWS for API access:
  - Enable "ActiveX and Socket Clients"
  - Disable "Read-Only API"
  - Set memory to 4GB
  - Configure paper trading on port 7497

### 2. Integration Tests
Create `tests/python/integration/` tests for:

#### Connection Tests
- [ ] `test_real_connection.py`
  - Connect to TWS
  - Verify server version
  - Test reconnection
  - Handle daily restart

#### Market Data Tests
- [ ] `test_market_data.py`
  - Subscribe to ticker data
  - Request option chains
  - Test subscription limits
  - Verify Greeks calculations

#### Order Tests
- [ ] `test_paper_trading.py`
  - Place test orders
  - whatIfOrder validation
  - Order status tracking
  - Vertical spread execution

#### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] `test_error_scenarios.py`
  - Pacing violations (Error 100)
  - Connection loss (Error 1100)
  - Invalid contracts
  - Market data errors

### 3. Missing Components
These need to be implemented with TWS testing:

#### Watchdog Component (`src/python/ibkr_connector/watchdog.py`)
```python
# TODO: Implement with real connection testing
- Automatic reconnection logic
- Daily restart handling
- Connection health monitoring
- State persistence
```

#### Trading Operations (`src/python/ibkr_connector/trading.py`)
```python
# TODO: Implement with paper trading
- Vertical spread order creation
- Order placement and tracking
- Position management
- Order modification/cancellation
```

#### Market Data Streaming (`src/python/ibkr_connector/market_data.py`)
```python
# TODO: Implement with real market data
- Options chain retrieval
- Real-time ticker updates
- Subscription management
- Data caching layer
```

### 4. Validation Checklist

Before marking Phase 1 complete:

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass on Windows
- [ ] Connection remains stable for 1+ hours
- [ ] Handles TWS daily restart gracefully
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents Error 100
- [ ] Watchdog recovers from disconnections
- [ ] Can place paper trades successfully
- [ ] Market data streams without errors
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<100ms latency)

### 5. Performance Testing

Run these benchmarks on Windows:
- Connection establishment time
- Request throughput (approaching 45 req/sec)
- Market data latency
- Order placement latency
- Memory usage over time

### 6. Documentation Updates

After Windows testing:
- [ ] Update API learnings in architecture doc
- [ ] Document any TWS quirks discovered
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update configuration recommendations

## Development Workflow

1. **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   # Activate virtual environment
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Run unit tests
   pytest tests/python/unit -v
   
   # Run integration tests (TWS must be running)
   pytest tests/python/integration -v -m "not slow"
   ```

2. **Test Connection:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_connection.py
   ```

3. **Run Paper Trading Test:**
   ```bash
   make paper-test
   ```

## Known TODOs in Code

Search for these markers:
- `TODO: Windows testing`
- `TODO: Implement with real connection`
- `TODO: Add more event handlers`

## Next Steps After Windows Testing

1. Complete missing components based on real TWS behavior
2. Run full integration test suite
3. Document any platform-specific considerations
4. Prepare for Phase 2 (Go Scanner) development

---

Remember: The foundation is solid. Focus on validating assumptions and implementing the remaining components based on actual TWS behavior.
