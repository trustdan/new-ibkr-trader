# Flow Journal - Day 1 Morning - Foundation Setup

## Morning Intention
- Energy level: 9/10
- Focus area: Creating a solid, vibe-conscious foundation
- Vibe: Methodical but inspired - laying down roots for something great

## Session Highlights
### Breakthroughs
- Created a project structure that feels natural and promotes flow
- Established async-first patterns from the very beginning
- Built in monitoring and metrics as first-class citizens
- Templates ready for rapid development without boilerplate

### Challenges
- Resisting the urge to over-engineer at this stage
- Keeping templates simple but comprehensive
- Balancing structure with flexibility

### Code Snippets
```python
# The pattern we'll use everywhere
async def do_something():
    await ib.sleep(1)  # Never time.sleep()!
```

## API Learnings
- Reinforced The One Rule: Never block the event loop
- Templates show event handler patterns that work
- Metrics mixin makes monitoring trivial to add
- Connection test in experiments validates setup

## Tomorrow's Flow
- Docker environment setup (async-aware containers)
- Test ib-insync connection patterns
- Create health check endpoints
- Start building the Python service foundation

## Vibe Check
- Flow state achieved: Yes! 
- Best working music/environment: Calm focus playlist, multiple monitors
- Commits made: 
  - "ðŸŒŸ Birth of IBKR Spread Automation" - Epic origin story commit

## Quick Notes
- The manifesto really captures the spirit of what we're building
- Event patterns template will save hours of debugging later
- Experiments folder already feels like a playground
- Project structure promotes natural code organization
- Ready to dive into Docker tomorrow with confidence
