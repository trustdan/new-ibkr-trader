# Flow Journal - 2025-01-13 - Day 6 Morning

## 🌅 Morning Intention
- Energy level: 9/10
- Focus area: Phase 1 - IBKR Connection Layer (Linux portion)
- Vibe: Building the foundation for TWS integration
- Started: 09:00

## 🎯 Session Goals
1. Design the Python IBKR connection wrapper architecture
2. Create src/python directory structure
3. Build base connection manager class (without TWS dependency)
4. Set up unit test framework
5. Document clear Windows handoff points

## 📋 Phase 1 Overview
Starting Phase 1: IBKR Connection Layer. This phase has both Linux and Windows components:
- **Linux work**: Architecture, base classes, unit tests, documentation
- **Windows work**: Actual TWS connection testing, integration tests

## 🖥️ Platform Strategy
Working on Linux today, focusing on:
- Architecture design that will work cross-platform
- Base classes with proper async patterns
- Mock-based unit tests that don't need TWS
- Clear documentation of what needs Windows testing

When we hit the Windows breakpoint:
- Connection validation with real TWS
- Integration tests with market data
- Error handling verification
- Rate limit testing

## 🌊 Flow State Preparation
- Virtual environment activated ✅
- Documentation reviewed ✅
- ib-insync patterns understood ✅
- Ready to architect the connection layer

## 💭 Morning Thoughts
Phase 1 begins! The key is to build a solid foundation on Linux that will seamlessly work when we move to Windows for testing. The async patterns we established in previous days will guide the architecture. Focus on clean abstractions that hide TWS complexity while exposing a simple, intuitive API.
