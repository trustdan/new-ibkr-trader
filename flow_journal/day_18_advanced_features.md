# Day 18: Advanced Scanner Features & Performance

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Phase**: 2 - Go Scanner Engine  
**Focus**: Advanced scoring, Greeks analysis, and performance optimization  

## Morning State

**Previous Achievement**: Python-Go Integration Complete!
- Scanner client with retry logic
- Coordinator with job management
- Backpressure handling (adaptive, circuit breaker)
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Full documentation

**Today's Mission**: Enhance scanner with sophisticated analysis and optimize performance.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Advanced Scoring Algorithms**
   - Multi-factor scoring model
   - Weighted scoring based on trader preferences
   - Risk-adjusted returns
   - Probability-weighted outcomes

2. **Greeks-Based Analysis**
   - Delta-neutral strategies
   - Gamma risk assessment
   - Theta decay optimization
   - Vega exposure management

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Benchmarking suite
   - Request batching
   - Parallel processing improvements
   - Memory optimization

4. **Monitoring Integration**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Performance dashboards
   - Alert rules
   - SLI/SLO tracking

## Technical Approach

### 1. Advanced Scoring Model

```go
type ScoringFactors struct {
    ProbabilityWeight   float64
    RiskRewardWeight    float64
    LiquidityWeight     float64
    GreeksWeight        float64
    VolatilityWeight    float64
}

func CalculateAdvancedScore(spread VerticalSpread, factors ScoringFactors) float64 {
    // Multi-factor scoring with customizable weights
}
```

### 2. Greeks Analysis Engine

```go
type GreeksAnalyzer struct {
    DeltaTargets    DeltaRange
    GammaLimits     GammaLimits
    ThetaThresholds ThetaThresholds
    VegaExposure    VegaLimits
}

func (g *GreeksAnalyzer) AnalyzeSpread(spread VerticalSpread) GreeksReport {
    // Comprehensive Greeks analysis
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- Request batching for multiple symbols
- Concurrent Greeks calculations
- Smart caching with predictive invalidation
- Memory pool for option data

## Implementation Plan

1. Create advanced scoring module
2. Implement Greeks analyzer
3. Add request batching to coordinator
4. Create benchmark suite
5. Integrate Prometheus metrics
6. Optimize hot paths

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Advanced scoring algorithm implemented
- [ ] Greeks-based filtering active
- [ ] 50% performance improvement on batch requests
- [ ] Prometheus metrics exposed
- [ ] Benchmark suite operational
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
