# Flow Journal - 2025-01-06

## Session Overview
- Focus area: Project foundation and vibe coding setup
- Energy level: 8/10
- Background music: None (focused silence)

## Achievements
- âœ¨ Created RULES.md as session start reference
- ðŸ“š Integrated IBKR TWS API requirements into ROADMAP.md and VISION.md
- ðŸŒŠ Established vibe coding principles and structure
- ðŸŽ¯ Set up flow journal for tracking creative momentum

## Breakthrough Moments
- Realized the importance of balancing TWS API's rigid requirements with vibe coding flexibility
- Found elegant way to structure RULES.md as both quick reference and philosophy guide
- Connected rate limiting constraints (45 req/sec) with flow state preservation

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Merging technical API constraints with creative development flow
- **Solution**: Created clear boundaries - rigid for API/security, flexible for exploration
- **Insight**: Good constraints can enhance creativity, not limit it

## Vibe Notes
- The project feels alive now with proper documentation structure
- RULES.md serves as a "north star" for each session
- Flow journal will capture the development story as it unfolds

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Begin Phase 0.2: Docker environment setup
- Create initial docker-compose.yml
- Set up Python container with ib-insync
- Maintain the momentum!
